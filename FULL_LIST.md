  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Attaining trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires meeting seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars, including being lawful, ethical, and robust both technically and socially. However, achieving truly trustworthy AI involves a more holistic vision that considers the trustworthiness of all processes and actors involved in the system's life cycle. This multidisciplinary approach contemplates four essential axes, including global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the seven requirements analyzed from a triple perspective. Additionally, a responsible AI system is introduced through a given auditing process, which is subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. This work emphasizes the importance of a regulation debate and serves as an entry point to this crucial field for the present and future progress of our society.

  - Key Word: Survey; Recommender Systems; Trustworthy Recommendation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of threats to RSs, coming from attacks, system and user generated noise, system bias. As a result, it has become clear that a strict focus on RS accuracy is limited and the research must consider other important factors, e.g., trustworthiness. For end users, a trustworthy RS (TRS) should not only be accurate, but also transparent, unbiased and fair as well as robust to noise or attacks. These observations actually led to a paradigm shift of the research on RSs: from accuracy-oriented RSs to TRSs. However, researchers lack a systematic overview and discussion of the literature in this novel and fast developing field of TRSs. To this end, in this paper, we provide an overview of TRSs, including a discussion of the motivation and basic concepts of TRSs, a presentation of the challenges in building TRSs, and a perspective on the future directions in this area.

<summary>Out-of-Distribution Generalization: 2023</summary>


- Unraveling the Key Components of OOD Generalization via Diversification. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16313)
  - Harold Benoit, Liangze Jiang, Andrei Atanov, Oğuzhan Fatih Kar, Mattia Rigotti, Amir Zamir.
  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Spurious Correlation; Diversification.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper investigates diversification methods for handling multiple features in real-world datasets. It finds that these methods are sensitive to the distribution of unlabeled data and can underperform when not in an optimal setting. Diversification alone is insufficient for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization; the choice of learning algorithm, model architecture, and pretraining is crucial. The optimal choice depends on the unlabeled data. Increasing the number of diverse hypotheses doesn't necessarily solve these issues. These findings provide insights into improving OOD generalization with diversification methods and offer guidance to practitioners and researchers in their use and development.

- Causal-structure Driven Augmentations for Text OOD Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12803)
  - Amir Feder, Yoav Wald, Claudia Shi, Suchi Saria, David Blei.
  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Causality; Data Augmentation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper proposes using counterfactual data augmentation to improve the robustness of text classifiers in situations where they rely on spurious correlations. This approach is particularly relevant in prediction problems where the label is spuriously correlated with an attribute. The authors discuss the advantages of counterfactual data augmentation in terms of sample complexity compared to other methods. They use auxiliary data and a large language model to represent conditional probabilities of text. Experimental results on caregiver-invariant predictors for clinical diagnoses show that this method enhances out-of-distribution accuracy compared to baseline techniques. 

- Does CLIP's Generalization Performance Mainly Stem from High Train-Test Similarity? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09562)
  - Prasanna Mayilvahanan, Thaddäus Wiedemer, Evgenia Rusak, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel.
  - Key Word: Measuring Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses CLIP, a foundation model, and its generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution benchmarks. It questions the significance of out-of-distribution generalization in CLIP, suggesting that web-scale datasets may contain samples similar to common benchmarks. The authors retrain CLIP on pruned data that replicates ImageNet's train-test similarity with OOD benchmarks, noting a performance drop on some benchmarks. Surprisingly, CLIP maintains high overall performance, indicating that factors beyond train-test similarity contribute to its generalization. Pruning dissimilar data reveals a smaller dataset on which CLIP can match its original OOD performance. 

- Mitigating Simplicity Bias in Deep Learning for Improved OOD Generalization and Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06161)
  - Bhavya Vasudeva, Kameron Shahabi, Vatsal Sharan.
  - Key Word: Simplicity Bias; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses the issue of simplicity bias in neural networks, where they tend to favor 'simple' features over more 'complex' but informative ones, leading to biased predictions and poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To mitigate this bias, the paper introduces a framework that involves training a simple model and then using conditional mutual information regularization to obtain the final model. This approach effectively counters simplicity bias, encourages the use of a wider range of features, improves OOD generalization, and enhances subgroup robustness and fairness in various problem settings and real-world applications. The paper also provides theoretical analysis of the regularization's impact and OOD generalization properties.

- Deep Neural Networks Tend To Extrapolate Predictably. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00873)
  - Katie Kang, Amrith Setlur, Claire Tomlin, Sergey Levine.
  - Key Word: Extrapolation; Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Optimal Constant Solution.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper challenges the common belief that neural network predictions become unpredictable and overconfident with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Instead, it finds that neural network predictions often stabilize around a constant value as data becomes more OOD, which closely approximates the optimal constant solution (OCS). This phenomenon is demonstrated across various datasets, loss functions, and architectures. The paper offers an explanation for this behavior, validates it empirically, and provides insights for enabling risk-sensitive decision-making in the presence of OOD inputs.

- Spurious Feature Diversification Improves Out-of-distribution Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17230)
  - Yong Lin, Lu Tan, Yifan Hao, Honam Wong, Hanze Dong, Weizhong Zhang, Yujiu Yang, Tong Zhang.
  - Key Word: Spurious Correlation; Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Ensemble-based Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data in machine learning. It focuses on the WiSE-FT ensemble method, which interpolates between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. The study discovers that WiSE-FT corrects cases where individual models make incorrect predictions, improving OOD performance. Theoretical analysis in a multi-class setting with spurious features predicts this phenomenon and suggests that ensemble models benefit from diverse spurious features. Contrary to conventional wisdom, incorporating many diverse spurious features weakens their individual contributions, leading to better OOD performance. Empirical results on MultiColorMNIST dataset support these findings. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel method called BAlaNced averaGing (BANG) to address overconfidence issues in fine-tuned models, further enhancing OOD performance in WiSE-FT.

- Robust Learning with Progressive Data Expansion Against Spurious Correlation. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04949)]
  - Yihe Deng*, Yu Yang*, Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Quanquan Gu.
  - Key Word: Spurious Correlation; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper theoretically examine the learning process of a two-layer nonlinear convolutional neural network in the presence of spurious features. Its analysis suggests that imbalanced data groups and easily learnable spurious features can lead to the dominance of spurious features during the early learning process. In light of this, it propose a new training algorithm called PDE that efficiently enhances the model's robustness for a better worst-group performance. PDE begins with a group-balanced subset of training data and progressively expands it to facilitate the learning of the core features. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of our method on models such as ResNets and Transformers.

- Context $\approx$ Environment. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09888)
  - Sharut Gupta, Stefanie Jegelka, David Lopez-Paz, Kartik Ahuja.
  - Key Word: In-Context Learning; Invaraint Learning; Domain Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper discusses two key areas in AI research: 1) efforts to build models that generalize better and avoid spurious correlations, and 2) the role of large language models (LLMs) in on-the-fly contextual learning. The paper argues that context is akin to the environment and suggests that in-context learning is essential for improved domain generalization. The proposed In-Context Risk Minimization (ICRM) algorithm, by paying attention to context, enhances out-of-distribution performance. The main takeaways are that domain generalization researchers should consider the environment as context, and LLM researchers should view context as an environment for improved data structuring towards generalization.

  - Key Word: Domain Adaptation; AUC-Oriented Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses the use of Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) as a crucial metric in machine learning, particularly for applications with long-tail datasets. It focuses on AUC-oriented Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and introduces a new distributional discrepancy for AUC. The paper overcomes the challenge of interdependency in AUC risk and provides a sharper bound with fewer assumptions about the loss function. To make it practical, a pseudo-labeling strategy and an end-to-end training framework are proposed for scenarios where complete annotations on the target domain are unavailable. Empirical studies on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.

- Understanding Hessian Alignment for Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11778)
  - Sobhan Hemati, Guojun Zhang, Amir Estiri, Xi Chen. *ICCV 2023*
  - Key Word: Hessian Alignment; Robust Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in deep learning models, which is crucial in real-world applications like healthcare and autonomous vehicles. It focuses on gradient-based regularizers' effectiveness and analyzes the role of Hessian and gradient alignment in domain generalization. The study establishes that the spectral norm between the classifier's head Hessian matrices across domains is an upper bound of the transfer measure. The success of various regularizers is explained by their alignment of Hessians and gradients. The paper proposes efficient methods for aligning Hessians and gradients, achieving promising OOD generalization results in different scenarios.

  - Key Word: Source-free; Domain Generalization; Prompt Learning; Vision-Language.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In a joint vision-language space, a text feature (e.g., from "a photo of a dog") could effectively represent its relevant image features (e.g., from dog photos). Inspired by this, this paper proposes PromptStyler which simulates various distribution shifts in the joint space by synthesizing diverse styles via prompts without using any images to deal with source-free domain generalization. 

- Spuriosity Didn't Kill the Classifier: Using Invariant Predictions to Harness Spurious Features. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09933)
  - Cian Eastwood, Shashank Singh, Andrei Liviu Nicolicioiu, Marin Vlastelica, Julius von Kügelgen, Bernhard Schölkopf.
  - Key Word: Spurious Correlation; Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces Stable Feature Boosting (SFB), an algorithm that leverages both stable and unstable features in the test domain without requiring labels for the test domain. By proving that pseudo-labels based on stable features are sufficient guidance, and given the conditional independence of stable and unstable features with respect to the label, SFB learns an asymptotically-optimal predictor. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of SFB on real and synthetic data for avoiding failures on out-of-distribution data.

  - Key Word: Group Robustness; Spurious Correlation; Feature Reweighting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper proposes Automatic Feature Reweighting (AFR), a simple and fast method for reducing the reliance on spurious features in machine learning models. By retraining the last layer of a standard model with a weighted loss that emphasizes poorly predicted examples, AFR automatically upweights the minority group without requiring group labels. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods on vision and natural language classification benchmarks.

- Optimal Transport Model Distributional Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04178)
  - Van-Anh Nguyen, Trung Le, Anh Tuan Bui, Thanh-Toan Do, Dinh Phung.
  - Key Word: Distributional Robustness; Optimal Transport; Sharpness-Aware Minimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work explores an optimal transport-based distributional robustness framework on model spaces, aiming to enhance the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial examples and data distribution shifts. Previous research has mainly focused on data space, but this study investigates the model distribution within a Wasserstein ball centered around a given model distribution. The authors develop theories to learn the optimal robust center model distribution, allowing for the incorporation of sharpness awareness into various model architectures such as single models, ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks. The framework encompasses sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) as a specific case and extends it to a probabilistic setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods in different settings.

- Explore and Exploit the Diverse Knowledge in Model Zoo for Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02595)
  - Yimeng Chen, Tianyang Hu, Fengwei Zhou, Zhenguo Li, Zhiming Ma.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Model Zoo; Pre-Trained Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses the challenge of effectively utilizing a wide range of publicly available pretrained models to enhance out-of-distribution generalization in downstream tasks. While previous research has focused on identifying the most powerful models, this study argues that even weaker models contain valuable knowledge. The authors propose a method that leverages the diversity within the model zoo by analyzing the variations in encoded representations across different domains. By characterizing these variations in terms of diversity shift and correlation shift, they develop an algorithm for integrating diverse pretrained models, not limited to the strongest ones, to improve out-of-distribution generalization.

  - Key Word: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper examines the generalization properties of Wasserstein distributionally robust estimators, which are models that optimize prediction and decision-making under uncertainty. The authors show that these estimators have robust objective functions that bound the true risk with high probability, and that these bounds do not depend on the dimensionality of the problem, the class of models, or the distribution shift at testing.

  - Han Yu, Xingxuan Zhang, Renzhe Xu, Jiashuo Liu, Yue He, Peng Cui.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Evaluation Protocol.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Domain generalization aims to solve the challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. To accurately evaluate the OOD generalization ability, it is necessary to ensure that test data information is unavailable. However, the current domain generalization protocol may still have potential test data information leakage. This paper examines the potential risks of test data information leakage in two aspects of the current protocol. We propose that training from scratch and using multiple test domains would result in a more precise evaluation of OOD generalization ability.

  - Key Word: Correlations between ID and OOD Performances; Accuracy-on-the-Line.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study shows that the correlation between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts than previously thought. The non-trivial nonlinear correlation holds across model architectures, hyperparameters, training durations, and the imbalance between subpopulations. The nonlinearity of the "moon shape" is influenced by spurious correlations in the training data. Understanding the nonlinear effects of model improvement on performance in different subpopulations is important for developing more equitable and responsible machine learning models.

  - Key Word: Unknown Distribution Drift.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop and analyze a general technique for learning with an unknown distribution drift. Given a sequence of independent observations from the last T steps of a drifting distribution, our algorithm agnostically learns a family of functions with respect to the current distribution at time T. Unlike previous work, our technique does not require prior knowledge about the magnitude of the drift.

  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Gradient Manipulation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop a novel DG training strategy, we call PGrad, to learn a robust gradient direction, improving models' generalization ability on unseen domains. The proposed gradient aggregates the principal directions of a sampled roll-out optimization trajectory that measures the training dynamics across all training domains. PGrad's gradient design forces the DG training to ignore domain-dependent noise signals and updates all training domains with a robust direction covering main components of parameter dynamics. 

- Benchmarking Low-Shot Robustness to Natural Distribution Shifts. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11263)
  - Aaditya Singh, Kartik Sarangmath, Prithvijit Chattopadhyay, Judy Hoffman.
  - Key Word: Natural Distribution Shifts; Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning; Benchmarks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Robustness to natural distribution shifts has seen remarkable progress thanks to recent pre-training strategies combined with better fine-tuning methods. However, such fine-tuning assumes access to large amounts of labelled data, and the extent to which the observations hold when the amount of training data is not as high remains unknown. We address this gap by performing the first in-depth study of robustness to various natural distribution shifts in different low-shot regimes: spanning datasets, architectures, pre-trained initializations, and state-of-the-art robustness interventions.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a simple yet practical framework, called reweighted mixup (RMIX), to mitigate the overfitting issue in over-parameterized models by conducting importance weighting on the ''mixed'' samples. Benefiting from leveraging reweighting in mixup, RMIX allows the model to explore the vicinal space of minority samples more, thereby obtaining more robust model against subpopulation shift.

  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Benchmarking; Weight Averaging; Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent work has shown that a well-tuned Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training procedure, that is simply minimizing the empirical risk on the source domains, can outperform most existing DG methods. We identify several key candidate techniques to further improve ERM performance, such as better utilization of training data, model parameter selection, and weight-space regularization. We call the resulting method ERM++, and show it significantly improves the performance of DG on five multi-source datasets by over 5% compared to standard ERM, and beats state-of-the-art despite being less computationally expensive.

  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Nuclear Norm Regularization; Low-Rank Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a simple and effective regularization method based on the nuclear norm of the learned features for domain generalization. Intuitively, the proposed regularizer mitigates the impacts of environmental features and encourages learning domain-invariant features. Theoretically, we provide insights into why nuclear norm regularization is more effective compared to ERM and alternative regularization methods.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our work is dedicated to investigating how natural corruption “robustness” is encoded in weights and how to disentangle/transfer them. We introduce “Robust Weight Signature”(RWS), which nontrivially generalizes the prior wisdom in model weight interpolation and arithmetic, to analyzing standard/robust models, with both methodological innovations and new key findings. RWSs lead to a powerful in-situ model patching framework to easily achieve on-demand robustness towards a wide range of corruptions.

With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations for future progress in this space.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> ChatGPT is a recent chatbot service released by OpenAI and is receiving increasing attention over the past few months. While evaluations of various aspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance when facing unexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular concern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study principles for designing data augmentations for out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. In particular, we focus on real-world scenarios in which some domain-dependent features are robust, i.e., some features that vary across domains are predictive OOD. For example, in the wildlife monitoring application above, image backgrounds vary across camera locations but indicate habitat type, which helps predict the species of photographed animals.

  - Key Word: Personalized Federated Learning; Knowledge Distillation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose PerAda, a parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational costs and exhibits superior generalization performance, especially under test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda has good generalization since it regularizes each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter, while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients.

  - Key Word: Heterogeneous Federated Minimax Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a general federated minimax optimization framework that subsumes such settings and several existing methods like Local SGDA. We show that naive aggregation of heterogeneous local progress results in optimizing a mismatched objective function -- a phenomenon previously observed in standard federated minimization. To fix this problem, we propose normalizing the client updates by the number of local steps undertaken between successive communication rounds.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We focus on domain shifts, which occur when the model is applied to new domains that are different from the ones it was trained on, and propose a new approach called D^3G. Unlike previous approaches that aim to learn a single model that is domain invariant, D^3G learns domain-specific models by leveraging the relations among different domains. 

- Effective Robustness against Natural Distribution Shifts for Models with Different Training Data. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01381)

  - Key Word: Effective Robustness; Natural Distribution Shifts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a new effective robustness evaluation metric to compare the effective robustness of models trained on different data distributions. To do this we control for the accuracy on multiple ID test sets that cover the training distributions for all the evaluated models. Our new evaluation metric provides a better estimate of the effectiveness robustness and explains the surprising effective robustness gains of zero-shot CLIP-like models exhibited when considering only one ID dataset, while the gains diminish under our evaluation.

  - Key Word: Domain Adversarial Training; Label Smoothing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We proposed Environment Label Smoothing (ELS), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels.

  - Tianfei Zhou, Ender Konukoglu. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Feature Augmentation; Feature Shifts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The primary goal of this paper is to develop a robust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients' samples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences in medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose FedFA to tackle federated learning from a distinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. FedFA is based on a major insight that each client's data distribution can be characterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent features; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e., based on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better sense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias.

We provide an information-theoretic analysis that suggests that there should be a U-shaped relationship between the degree of representational alignment with humans and performance on few-shot learning tasks. We confirm this prediction empirically, finding such a relationship in an analysis of the performance of 491 computer vision models.

To overcome these limitations of DA and DG in handling the Unfamiliar Period during continual domain shift, we propose RaTP, a framework that focuses on improving models' target domain generalization (TDG) capability, while also achieving effective target domain adaptation (TDA) capability right after training on certain domains and forgetting alleviation (FA) capability on past domains.

  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Healthcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In healthcare applications, most existing domain generalization methods assume a small number of domains. In this paper, considering the diversity of patient covariates, we propose a new setting by treating each patient as a separate domain (leading to many domains). We develop a new domain generalization method ManyDG, that can scale to such many-domain problems. Our method identifies the patient domain covariates by mutual reconstruction and removes them via an orthogonal projection step.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a challenging and untouched problem: Open-Set Single Domain Generalization (OS-SDG), where target domains include unseen categories out of source label space. The goal of OS-SDG is to learn a model, with only one source domain, to classify a target sample with correct class if it belongs to source label space, or assign it to unknown classes. We design a CrossMatch approach to improve the performance of SDG methods on identifying unknown classes by leveraging a multi-binary classifier.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose invariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e., nonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a practical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e., a set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the environment belongs to general exponential family distributions, i.e., a more flexible conditionally non-factorized prior that can actually capture complicated dependences between the latent variables.

We then develop an encoder-decoder network to map each input image into a new image space where the learned domain-specific features are removed.

  - Key Word: Stability; Robustness; Distributional Uncertainty; Model Misspecification.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The performance of decision policies and prediction models often deteriorates when applied to environments different from the ones seen during training. To ensure reliable operation, we propose and analyze the stability of a system under distribution shift, which is defined as the smallest change in the underlying environment that causes the system's performance to deteriorate beyond a permissible threshold. In contrast to standard tail risk measures and distributionally robust losses that require the specification of a plausible magnitude of distribution shift, the stability measure is defined in terms of a more intuitive quantity: the level of acceptable performance degradation.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that generative models alone are not sufficient to prevent shortcut learning, despite an incentive to recover a more comprehensive representation of the data than discriminative approaches. However, we observe that shortcuts are preferentially encoded with minimal information, a fact that generative models can exploit to mitigate shortcut learning. In particular, we propose Chroma-VAE, a two-pronged approach where a VAE classifier is initially trained to isolate the shortcut in a small latent subspace, allowing a secondary classifier to be trained on the complementary, shortcut-free latent subspace.

To address this gap, we curate Wild-Time, a benchmark of 5 datasets that reflect temporal distribution shifts arising in a variety of real-world applications, including patient prognosis and news classification. On these datasets, we systematically benchmark 13 prior approaches, including methods in domain generalization, continual learning, self-supervised learning, and ensemble learning.

  - Key Word: Spurious Correlations; Feature Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We evaluate the amount of information about the core (non-spurious) features that can be decoded from the representations learned by standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) and specialized group robustness training. Following recent work on Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR), we evaluate the feature representations by re-training the last layer of the model on a held-out set where the spurious correlation is broken.

  - Key Word: Feature Learning; Spurious Correlations.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We find that core features are only learned well when they are less noisy than spurious features, which is not necessarily true in practice. We provide both theories and experiments to support this finding and to illustrate the importance of feature noise. Moreover, we propose an algorithm called Freeze then Train (FTT), that first freezes certain salient features and then trains the rest of the features using ERM.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Pre-Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose ZooD, a paradigm for PTMs ranking and ensemble with feature selection. Our proposed metric ranks PTMs by quantifying inter-class discriminability and inter-domain stability of the features extracted by the PTMs in a leave-one-domain-out cross-validation manner. The top-K ranked models are then aggregated for the target OoD task. To avoid accumulating noise induced by model ensemble, we propose an efficient variational EM algorithm to select informative features. We evaluate our paradigm on a diverse model zoo consisting of 35 models for various OoD tasks.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Adversarial Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We empirically show that sample-wise AT has limited improvement on OOD performance. Specifically, we find that AT can only maintain performance at smaller scales of perturbation while Universal AT (UAT) is more robust to larger-scale perturbations. This provides us with clues that adversarial perturbations with universal (low dimensional) structures can enhance the robustness against large data distribution shifts that are common in OOD scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose two AT variants with low-rank structures to train OOD-robust models.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We improve upon the top-1 accuracy of a non-adversarially trained ViT-B16 model by +1.12% on ImageNet (reaching 83.76% top-1 accuracy). Second, and more importantly, we show that training with adapters enables model soups through linear combinations of the clean and adversarial tokens. These model soups, which we call adversarial model soups, allow us to trade-off between clean and robust accuracy without sacrificing efficiency. Finally, we show that we can easily adapt the resulting models in the face of distribution shifts.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Distributionally robust optimization has been shown to offer a principled way to regularize learning models. In this paper, we find that Tikhonov regularization is distributionally robust in an optimal transport sense (i.e., if an adversary chooses distributions in a suitable optimal transport neighborhood of the empirical measure), provided that suitable martingale constraints are also imposed. Further, we introduce a relaxation of the martingale constraints which not only provides a unified viewpoint to a class of existing robust methods but also leads to new regularization tools.

  - Key Word: Personalized Federated Learning; Maximal Coding Rate Reduction.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a federated methodology to learn low-dimensional representations from a dataset that is distributed among several clients. In particular, we move away from the commonly-used cross-entropy loss in federated learning, and seek to learn shared low-dimensional representations of the data in a decentralized manner via the principle of maximal coding rate reduction (MCR2). Our proposed method, which we refer to as FLOW, utilizes MCR2 as the objective of choice, hence resulting in representations that are both between-class discriminative and within-class compressible.

  - Key Word: Input Masking; Robustness to Spurious Correlations.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A fundamental challenge of over-parameterized deep learning models is learning meaningful data representations that yield good performance on a downstream task without over-fitting spurious input features. This work proposes MaskTune, a masking strategy that prevents over-reliance on spurious (or a limited number of) features. MaskTune forces the trained model to explore new features during a single epoch finetuning by masking previously discovered features. MaskTune, unlike earlier approaches for mitigating shortcut learning, does not require any supervision, such as annotating spurious features or labels for subgroup samples in a dataset.

We then introduce simple modifications to a learned optimizer's architecture and meta-training procedure which lead to improved stability, and improve the optimizer's inductive bias.

The training-trajectories-based uncertainty estimation is equipped in the proposed Umix for each sample to flexibly characterize the subpopulation distribution. We also provide insightful theoretical analysis to verify that Umix achieves better generalization bounds over prior works.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We find that knowledge distillation is a strong candidate for solving the problem: it outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods that were developed using large models with a large margin. Moreover, we observe that the teacher-student performance gap on test data with domain shift is bigger than that on in-distribution data. To improve DG for tiny neural networks without increasing the deployment cost, we propose a simple idea called out-of-distribution knowledge distillation (OKD), which aims to teach the student how the teacher handles (synthetic) out-of-distribution data and is proved to be a promising framework for solving the problem.

They may have been missed in past studies because of a biased selection of models. We show an example of the pattern on the WILDS-Camelyon17 dataset, using models from multiple training epochs and random seeds. Our observations are particularly striking on models trained with a regularizer that diversifies the solutions to the ERM objective.

Leveraging the newly formulated optimization problem, we propose a robust version of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD), coined Distributionally Robust Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DR-DSGD).

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a series of natural language understanding tasks. However, these LLMs might rely on dataset bias and artifacts as shortcuts for prediction. This has significantly hurt their Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization and adversarial robustness. In this paper, we provide a review of recent developments that address the robustness challenge of LLMs. We first introduce the concepts and robustness challenge of LLMs. We then introduce methods to identify shortcut learning behavior in LLMs, characterize the reasons for shortcut learning, as well as introduce mitigation solutions. Finally, we identify key challenges and introduce the connections of this line of research to other directions.

- A Unified Causal View of Domain Invariant Representation Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06987) [[code]](https://github.com/zihao12/causal_da_code)
  - Zihao Wang, Victor Veitch.
  - Key Word: Causality; Data Augmentation; Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Machine learning methods can be unreliable when deployed in domains that differ from the domains on which they were trained. To address this, we may wish to learn representations of data that are domain-invariant in the sense that we preserve data structure that is stable across domains, but throw out spuriously-varying parts. There are many representation-learning approaches of this type, including methods based on data augmentation, distributional invariances, and risk invariance. Unfortunately, when faced with any particular real-world domain shift, it is unclear which, if any, of these methods might be expected to work. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different methods relate to each other, and clarify the real-world circumstances under which each is expected to succeed. The key tool is a new notion of domain shift relying on the idea that causal relationships are invariant, but non-causal relationships (e.g., due to confounding) may vary.

  - Key Word: Invarinat Learning; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context bias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction, renders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled) as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels). We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We attempt to explore ViTs towards addressing the DG problem. Similar to CNNs, ViTs also struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios and the main culprit is overfitting to source domains. Inspired by the modular architecture of ViTs, we propose a simple DG approach for ViTs, coined as self-distillation for ViTs. It reduces the overfitting to source domains by easing the learning of input-output mapping problem through curating non-zero entropy supervisory signals for intermediate transformer blocks.

  - Key Word: Visual Inductive Bias; Data-Efficient Learning; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> First, compared to sufficient data, we show why insufficient data renders the model more easily biased to the limited training environments that are usually different from testing. For example, if all the training swan samples are "white", the model may wrongly use the "white" environment to represent the intrinsic class swan. Then, we justify that equivariance inductive bias can retain the class feature while invariance inductive bias can remove the environmental feature, leaving the class feature that generalizes to any environmental changes in testing. To impose them on learning, for equivariance, we demonstrate that any off-the-shelf contrastive-based self-supervised feature learning method can be deployed; for invariance, we propose a class-wise invariant risk minimization (IRM) that efficiently tackles the challenge of missing environmental annotation in conventional IRM.

Mutual invariance means that the features can be learned with multiple domains (cross-domain) and the features contain common information, i.e., the transferable features w.r.t. other domains.

The model can only fetch and re-use a limited number of these (key, value) pairs during inference, enabling localized and context-dependent model updates.

With 15 evaluation scenarios, we present both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results of nine existing popular open-sourced FL frameworks, from the perspectives of functionality, usability, and system performance. We also provide suggestions on framework selection based on the benchmark conclusions and point out future improvement directions.

The latter leverages an explainable model and generates explanations justifying the rationale behind its decision.

  - Key Word: Compositional Generalization; Domain Generalization; Learning Independent Representations.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Shortcut learning occurs when a deep neural network overly relies on spurious correlations in the training dataset in order to solve downstream tasks. Prior works have shown how this impairs the compositional generalization capability of deep learning models. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to mitigate shortcut learning in uncontrolled target domains. Our approach extends the training set with an additional dataset (the source domain), which is specifically designed to facilitate learning independent representations of basic visual factors. We benchmark our idea on synthetic target domains where we explicitly control shortcut opportunities as well as real-world target domains.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A recent study found that no DG algorithm outperformed empirical risk minimization in terms of average performance. In this work, we argue that DG is neither a worst-case problem nor an average-case problem, but rather a probabilistic one. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework for DG, which we call Probable Domain Generalization, wherein our key idea is that distribution shifts seen during training should inform us of probable shifts at test time. To realize this, we explicitly relate training and test domains as draws from the same underlying meta-distribution, and propose a new optimization problem -- Quantile Risk Minimization (QRM) -- which requires that predictors generalize with high probability.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Transfer Learning; Calibration; Adversarial Robustness; Corruption Robustness; Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Since out-of-distribution generalization is a generally ill-posed problem, various proxy targets (e.g., calibration, adversarial robustness, algorithmic corruptions, invariance across shifts) were studied across different research programs resulting in different recommendations. While sharing the same aspirational goal, these approaches have never been tested under the same experimental conditions on real data. In this paper, we take a unified view of previous work, highlighting message discrepancies that we address empirically, and providing recommendations on how to measure the robustness of a model and how to improve it. To this end, we collect 172 publicly available dataset pairs for training and out-of-distribution evaluation of accuracy, calibration error, adversarial attacks, environment invariance, and synthetic corruptions. We fine-tune over 31k networks, from nine different architectures in the many- and few-shot setting.

  - Weijian Deng, Stephen Gould, Liang Zheng.
  - Key Word: Predicting Generalization Gap; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> First, we introduce effective invariance (EI), a simple and reasonable measure of model invariance which does not rely on image labels. Given predictions on a test image and its transformed version, EI measures how well the predictions agree and with what level of confidence. Second, using invariance scores computed by EI, we perform large-scale quantitative correlation studies between generalization and invariance, focusing on rotation and grayscale transformations. From a model-centric view, we observe generalization and invariance of different models exhibit a strong linear relationship, on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. From a dataset-centric view, we find a certain model's accuracy and invariance linearly correlated on different test sets.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Conditional Spurious Variation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recently, generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) data with correlation shift has attracted great attention. The correlation shift is caused by the spurious attributes that correlate to the class label, as the correlation between them may vary in training and test data. For such a problem, we show that given the class label, the conditionally independent models of spurious attributes are OOD generalizable. Based on this, a metric Conditional Spurious Variation (CSV) which controls OOD generalization error, is proposed to measure such conditional independence. To improve the OOD generalization, we regularize the training process with the proposed CSV.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> There still is no clear understanding of the conditions on OOD data and model properties that are required to observe effective robustness. We approach this issue by conducting a comprehensive empirical study of diverse approaches that are known to impact OOD robustness on a broad range of natural and synthetic distribution shifts of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. In particular, we view the "effective robustness puzzle" through a Fourier lens and ask how spectral properties of both models and OOD data influence the corresponding effective robustness.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Underspecification; Ensembles; Feature Diversity.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We formalize the concept of underspecification and propose a method to identify and partially address it. We train multiple models with an independence constraint that forces them to implement different functions. They discover predictive features that are otherwise ignored by standard empirical risk minimization (ERM), which we then distill into a global model with superior OOD performance. Importantly, we constrain the models to align with the data manifold to ensure that they discover meaningful features. We demonstrate the method on multiple datasets in computer vision (collages, WILDS-Camelyon17, GQA) and discuss general implications of underspecification. Most notably, in-domain performance cannot serve for OOD model selection without additional assumptions.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Reliable generalization lies at the heart of safe ML and AI. However, understanding when and how neural networks generalize remains one of the most important unsolved problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (2200 models, 16 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs.

However, robustness of these approaches against real-world perturbations has not been studied. In this work, we perform the first extensive robustness study of such models against various real-world perturbations focusing on video and language. We focus on text-to-video retrieval and propose two large-scale benchmark datasets, MSRVTT-P and YouCook2-P, which utilize 90 different visual and 35 different textual perturbations.

  - Key Word: Measures of Complexity; Predicting Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Measuring Function Smoothness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent work has proposed a variety of complexity measures that directly predict or theoretically bound the generalization capacity of a model. However, these methods rely on a strong set of assumptions that in practice are not always satisfied. Motivated by the limited settings in which existing measures can be applied, we propose a novel complexity measure based on the local manifold smoothness of a classifier. We define local manifold smoothness as a classifier's output sensitivity to perturbations in the manifold neighborhood around a given test point. Intuitively, a classifier that is less sensitive to these perturbations should generalize better.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> When designing a diagnostic model for a clinical application, it is crucial to guarantee the robustness of the model with respect to a wide range of image corruptions. Herein, an easy-to-use benchmark is established to evaluate how deep neural networks perform on corrupted pathology images. Specifically, corrupted images are generated by injecting nine types of common corruptions into validation images. Besides, two classification and one ranking metrics are designed to evaluate the prediction and confidence performance under corruption.

- Towards out of distribution generalization for problems in mechanics. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14917)
  - Lingxiao Yuan, Harold S. Park, Emma Lejeune.
  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization assumes that the test data may shift (i.e., violate the i.i.d. assumption). To date, multiple methods have been proposed to improve the OOD generalization of ML methods. However, because of the lack of benchmark datasets for OOD regression problems, the efficiency of these OOD methods on regression problems, which dominate the mechanics field, remains unknown. To address this, we investigate the performance of OOD generalization methods for regression problems in mechanics. Specifically, we identify three OOD problems: covariate shift, mechanism shift, and sampling bias. For each problem, we create two benchmark examples that extend the Mechanical MNIST dataset collection, and we investigate the performance of popular OOD generalization methods on these mechanics-specific regression problems.

  - Key Word: Pre-training; Self-Supervion; Fine-tuning; Regularization; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> One unexpected technique that emerged in recent years consists in training a Deep Network (DN) with a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) method, and using this network on downstream tasks but with its last few layers entirely removed. This usually skimmed-over trick is actually critical for SSL methods to display competitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30 points of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one would hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by the SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for best generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this study sheds some light on why. This trick, which we name Guillotine Regularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable form of regularization that has also been used to improve generalization performance in transfer learning scenarios. In this work, through theory and experiments, we formalize GR and identify the underlying reasons behind its success in SSL methods.

  - Christina Baek, Yiding Jiang, Aditi Raghunathan, Zico Kolter.
  - Key Word: estimating Generalization Error; Distribution Shift.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recently, Miller et al. showed that a model's in-distribution (ID) accuracy has a strong linear correlation with its out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy on several OOD benchmarks -- a phenomenon they dubbed ''accuracy-on-the-line''. While a useful tool for model selection (i.e., the model most likely to perform the best OOD is the one with highest ID accuracy), this fact does not help estimate the actual OOD performance of models without access to a labeled OOD validation set. In this paper, we show a similar but surprising phenomenon also holds for the agreement between pairs of neural network classifiers: whenever accuracy-on-the-line holds, we observe that the OOD agreement between the predictions of any two pairs of neural networks (with potentially different architectures) also observes a strong linear correlation with their ID agreement.

Then, with enriched domain information as input, a Domain Adapter could adaptively aggregate discriminative information from multiple views for news in various domains.

  - Key Word: Multi-Source Domain Generalization; Invariant Elementary Distributions.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Distribution shift (DS) is a common problem that deteriorates the performance of learning machines. To overcome this problem, we postulate that real-world distributions are composed of elementary distributions that remain invariant across different domains. We call this an invariant elementary distribution (I.E.D.) assumption. This invariance thus enables knowledge transfer to unseen domains. To exploit this assumption in domain generalization (DG), we developed a modular neural network layer that consists of Gated Domain Units (GDUs). Each GDU learns an embedding of an individual elementary domain that allows us to encode the domain similarities during the training. During inference, the GDUs compute similarities between an observation and each of the corresponding elementary distributions which are then used to form a weighted ensemble of learning machines.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We demonstrate that the accuracy of the models trained with DG methods varies significantly across unseen domains, generated from popular benchmark datasets. This highlights that the performance of DG methods on a few benchmark datasets may not be representative of their performance on unseen domains in the wild. To overcome this roadblock, we propose a universal certification framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that can efficiently certify the worst-case performance of any DG method. This enables a data-independent evaluation of a DG method complementary to the empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets.

  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Pre-training; Bayesian Neural Networks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop ShiftMatch, a new training-data-dependent likelihood for out of distribution (OOD) robustness in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). ShiftMatch is inspired by the training-data-dependent "EmpCov" priors from Izmailov et al. (2021a) and efficiently matches test-time spatial correlations to those at training time. Critically, ShiftMatch is designed to leave neural network training unchanged, allowing it to use publically available samples from pretrained BNNs. Using pre-trained HMC samples, ShiftMatch gives strong performance improvements on CIFAR-10-C, outperforms EmpCov priors, and is perhaps the first Bayesian method capable of convincingly outperforming plain deep ensembles.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Learning representations that capture the underlying data generating process is a key problem for data efficient and robust use of neural networks. One key property for robustness which the learned representation should capture and which recently received a lot of attention is described by the notion of invariance. In this work we provide a causal perspective and new algorithm for learning invariant representations. Empirically we show that this algorithm works well on a diverse set of tasks and in particular we observe state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization, where we are able to significantly boost the score of existing models.

  - Key Word: Pre-training; Federated Learning; Training with Sythetic Data.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In most of the literature on federated learning (FL), neural networks are initialized with random weights. In this paper, we present an empirical study on the effect of pre-training on FL. Specifically, we aim to investigate if pre-training can alleviate the drastic accuracy drop when clients' decentralized data are non-IID. We focus on FedAvg, the fundamental and most widely used FL algorithm. We found that pre-training does largely close the gap between FedAvg and centralized learning under non-IID data, but this does not come from alleviating the well-known model drifting problem in FedAvg's local training. Instead, how pre-training helps FedAvg is by making FedAvg's global aggregation more stable. When pre-training using real data is not feasible for FL, we propose a novel approach to pre-train with synthetic data.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show empirically that DNNs can be coaxed to avoid poor shortcuts by providing an additional "priming" feature computed from key input features, usually a coarse output estimate. Priming relies on approximate domain knowledge of these task-relevant key input features, which is often easy to obtain in practical settings. For example, one might prioritize recent frames over past frames in a video input for visual imitation learning, or salient foreground over background pixels for image classification.

Motivated by this connection, we present federated versions of popular DG algorithms, and show that by applying appropriate data augmentation, we can mitigate data heterogeneity in the federated setting, and obtain higher accuracy on unseen clients. Equipped with data augmentation, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance using even the most basic Federated Averaging algorithm, with much sparser communication.

Secondly, to reduce the communication and computation costs, we propose decoupled federated learning (DecoupleFL).

However, there is a lack of insight on how spurious correlations affect the performance of popular self-supervised learning (SSL) and auto-encoder based models (AE). In this work, we shed light on this by evaluating the performance of these models on both real world and synthetic distribution shift datasets. Following observations that the linear head itself can be susceptible to spurious correlations, we develop a novel evaluation scheme with the linear head trained on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, to isolate the performance of the pre-trained models from a potential bias of the linear head used for evaluation.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Currently, there lacks a systematic benchmark tailored to graph OOD method evaluation. In this work, we aim at developing an OOD benchmark, known as GOOD, for graphs specifically. We explicitly make distinctions between covariate and concept shifts and design data splits that accurately reflect different shifts. We consider both graph and node prediction tasks as there are key differences when designing shifts. Overall, GOOD contains 8 datasets with 14 domain selections. When combined with covariate, concept, and no shifts, we obtain 42 different splits. We provide performance results on 7 commonly used baseline methods with 10 random runs. This results in 294 dataset-model combinations in total.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Multi-attribute Distribution Shifts; Causal Graph.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Real-world data collected from multiple domains can have multiple, distinct distribution shifts over multiple attributes. However, state-of-the art advances in domain generalization (DG) algorithms focus only on specific shifts over a single attribute. We introduce datasets with multi-attribute distribution shifts and find that existing DG algorithms fail to generalize. To explain this, we use causal graphs to characterize the different types of shifts based on the relationship between spurious attributes and the classification label. Each multi-attribute causal graph entails different constraints over observed variables, and therefore any algorithm based on a single, fixed independence constraint cannot work well across all shifts. We present Causally Adaptive Constraint Minimization (CACM), a new algorithm for identifying the correct independence constraints for regularization.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Despite the success of invariant risk minimization (IRM) in tackling the Out-of-Distribution generalization problem, IRM can compromise the optimality when applied in practice. The practical variants of IRM, e.g., IRMv1, have been shown to have significant gaps with IRM and thus could fail to capture the invariance even in simple problems. Moreover, the optimization procedure in IRMv1 involves two intrinsically conflicting objectives, and often requires careful tuning for the objective weights. To remedy the above issues, we reformulate IRM as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose a new optimization scheme for IRM, called PAreto Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR).

An aggregation mechanism then selects the optimal classifier based on a graph structure that reflects the causal mechanisms in the data more accurately compared to the structures learnt from individual environments.

Under the GSmooth framework, we present a scalable algorithm that uses a surrogate image-to-image network to approximate the complex transformation.

We then leverage the results on multi-marginal optimal transport problems to formulate FedOT as a min-max optimization problem and analyze its generalization and optimization properties.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Neuro-Symbolic Generative Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Learning general-purpose representations from perceptual inputs is a hallmark of human intelligence. For example, people can write out numbers or characters, or even draw doodles, by characterizing these tasks as different instantiations of the same generic underlying process -- compositional arrangements of different forms of pen strokes. Crucially, learning to do one task, say writing, implies reasonable competence at another, say drawing, on account of this shared process. We present Drawing out of Distribution (DooD), a neuro-symbolic generative model of stroke-based drawing that can learn such general-purpose representations. In contrast to prior work, DooD operates directly on images, requires no supervision or expensive test-time inference, and performs unsupervised amortised inference with a symbolic stroke model that better enables both interpretability and generalization.

We show that the robustness of WAFL is more general than related approaches, and the generalization bound is robust to all adversarial distributions inside the Wasserstein ball (ambiguity set).

- Federated Learning under Distributed Concept Drift. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00799)

  - Key Word: Concept Drift; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our work is the first to explicitly study data heterogeneity in both dimensions. We first demonstrate that prior solutions to drift adaptation, with their single global model, are ill-suited to staggered drifts, necessitating multi-model solutions. We identify the problem of drift adaptation as a time-varying clustering problem, and we propose two new clustering algorithms for reacting to drifts based on local drift detection and hierarchical clustering.

- Evolving Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00047)
  - Wei Wang, Gezheng Xu, Ruizhi Pu, Jiaqi Li, Fan Zhou, Changjian Shui, Charles Ling, Christian Gagné, Boyu Wang.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Domain generalization aims to learn a predictive model from multiple different but related source tasks that can generalize well to a target task without the need of accessing any target data. Existing domain generalization methods ignore the relationship between tasks, implicitly assuming that all the tasks are sampled from a stationary environment. Therefore, they can fail when deployed in an evolving environment. To this end, we formulate and study the \emph{evolving domain generalization} (EDG) scenario, which exploits not only the source data but also their evolving pattern to generate a model for the unseen task.

- Evaluating Robustness to Dataset Shift via Parametric Robustness Sets. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15947)
  - Nikolaj Thams, Michael Oberst, David Sontag.
  - Key Word: Distributionally Robust Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We give a method for proactively identifying small, plausible shifts in distribution which lead to large differences in model performance. To ensure that these shifts are plausible, we parameterize them in terms of interpretable changes in causal mechanisms of observed variables. This defines a parametric robustness set of plausible distributions and a corresponding worst-case loss. While the loss under an individual parametric shift can be estimated via reweighting techniques such as importance sampling, the resulting worst-case optimization problem is non-convex, and the estimate may suffer from large variance.

  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causal Structure Learning; Domain Adaptation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the following question: If a representation is approximately invariant with respect to a given number of training interventions, will it continue to be approximately invariant on a larger collection of unseen SEMs? This larger collection of SEMs is generated through a parameterized family of interventions. Inspired by PAC learning, we obtain finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization guarantees for approximate invariance that holds probabilistically over a family of linear SEMs without faithfulness assumptions.

  - Key Word: Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We identify a fundamental flaw of IRM formulation that causes the failure. We then introduce a complementary notion of invariance, MRI, that is based on conserving the class-conditioned feature expectation across environments, that corrects for the flaw in IRM. Further, we introduce a simplified, practical version of the MRI formulation called as MRI-v1. We note that this constraint is convex which confers it with an advantage over the practical version of IRM, IRM-v1, which imposes non-convex constraints. We prove that in a general linear problem setting, MRI-v1 can guarantee invariant predictors given sufficient environments.

  - Sharut Gupta, Kartik Ahuja, Mohammad Havaei, Niladri Chatterjee, Yoshua Bengio.
  - Key Word: Distribution Shifts; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We argue that in order to generalize better across non-i.i.d. clients, it is imperative to only learn correlations that are stable and invariant across domains. We propose FL Games, a game-theoretic framework for federated learning for learning causal features that are invariant across clients. While training to achieve the Nash equilibrium, the traditional best response strategy suffers from high-frequency oscillations. We demonstrate that FL Games effectively resolves this challenge and exhibits smooth performance curves.

  - Siddhartha Datta, Nigel Shadbolt.
  - Key Word: Distribution Shifts; Weight Averaging; Test-time distributions; Task interpolation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Inspired by recent work on neural subspaces and mode connectivity, we revisit parameter subspace sampling for shifted and/or interpolatable input distributions (instead of a single, unshifted distribution). We enforce a compressed geometric structure upon a set of trained parameters mapped to a set of train-time distributions, denoting the resulting subspaces as Compressed Parameter Subspaces (CPS). We show the success and failure modes of the types of shifted distributions whose optimal parameters reside in the CPS. We find that ensembling point-estimates within a CPS can yield a high average accuracy across a range of test-time distributions, including backdoor, adversarial, permutation, stylization and rotation perturbations.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose the Decision Region Quantification (DRQ) algorithm to improve the robustness of any differentiable pre-trained model against both real-world and worst-case distribution shifts in the data. DRQ analyzes the robustness of local decision regions in the vicinity of a given data point to make more reliable predictions. We theoretically motivate the DRQ algorithm by showing that it effectively smooths spurious local extrema in the decision surface.

Specifically, we assume that each input is constructed from a mix of causal factors (whose relationship with the label is invariant across domains) and non-causal factors (category-independent), and only the former cause the classification judgments. Our goal is to extract the causal factors from inputs and then reconstruct the invariant causal mechanisms.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that averaging the weights of multiple models fine-tuned with different hyperparameter configurations often improves accuracy and robustness. Unlike a conventional ensemble, we may average many models without incurring any additional inference or memory costs -- we call the results "model soups." When fine-tuning large pre-trained models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and a ViT-G pre-trained on JFT, our soup recipe provides significant improvements over the best model in a hyperparameter sweep on ImageNet.

- Continual Feature Selection: Spurious Features in Continual Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01012)
  - Timothée Lesort.
  - Key Word: Spurious Correlations; Continual Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper studies spurious features' influence on continual learning algorithms. We show that continual learning algorithms solve tasks by selecting features that are not generalizable. Our experiments highlight that continual learning algorithms face two related problems: (1) spurious features and (2) local spurious features. The first one is due to a covariate shift between training and testing data, while the second is due to the limited access to data at each training step. We study (1) through a consistent set of continual learning experiments varying spurious correlation amount and data distribution support. We show that (2) is a major cause of performance decrease in continual learning along with catastrophic forgetting. 

- Fine-Tuning can Distort Pretrained Features and Underperform Out-of-Distribution. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10054) [[code]](https://github.com/AnanyaKumar/transfer_learning)
  - Ananya Kumar, Aditi Raghunathan, Robbie Jones, Tengyu Ma, Percy Liang.
  - Key Word: Fine-Tuning; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show theoretically that this tradeoff between ID and OOD accuracy arises even in a simple setting: fine-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks. We prove that the OOD error of fine-tuning is high when we initialize with a fixed or random head -- this is because while fine-tuning learns the head, the lower layers of the neural network change simultaneously and distort the pretrained features. Our analysis suggests that the easy two-step strategy of linear probing then full fine-tuning (LP-FT), sometimes used as a fine-tuning heuristic, combines the benefits of both fine-tuning and linear probing.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Uncertainty.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We improve the network generalization ability by modeling the uncertainty of domain shifts with synthesized feature statistics during training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature statistic, after considering the potential uncertainties, follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Hence, each feature statistic is no longer a deterministic value, but a probabilistic point with diverse distribution possibilities. With the uncertain feature statistics, the models can be trained to alleviate the domain perturbations and achieve better robustness against potential domain shifts.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> 3D perception, especially point cloud classification, has achieved substantial progress. However, in real-world deployment, point cloud corruptions are inevitable due to the scene complexity, sensor inaccuracy, and processing imprecision. In this work, we aim to rigorously benchmark and analyze point cloud classification under corruptions. To conduct a systematic investigation, we first provide a taxonomy of common 3D corruptions and identify the atomic corruptions. Then, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on a wide range of representative point cloud models to understand their robustness and generalizability.

We propose a novel certification framework given bounded distance of mean and variance of two distributions. Our certification technique scales to ImageNet-scale datasets, complex models, and a diverse range of loss functions. We then focus on one specific application enabled by such scalability and flexibility, i.e., certifying out-of-domain generalization for large neural networks and loss functions such as accuracy and AUC.

  - Key Word: Certified Distributional Robustness; Corruption Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Certified robustness in machine learning has primarily focused on adversarial perturbations of the input with a fixed attack budget for each point in the data distribution. In this work, we present provable robustness guarantees on the accuracy of a model under bounded Wasserstein shifts of the data distribution. We show that a simple procedure that randomizes the input of the model within a transformation space is provably robust to distributional shifts under the transformation. Our framework allows the datum-specific perturbation size to vary across different points in the input distribution and is general enough to include fixed-sized perturbations as well.

  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Data Augmentation; Calibration; Anomaly Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In real-world applications of machine learning, reliable and safe systems must consider measures of performance beyond standard test set accuracy. These other goals include out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, prediction consistency, resilience to adversaries, calibrated uncertainty estimates, and the ability to detect anomalous inputs. However, improving performance towards these goals is often a balancing act that today's methods cannot achieve without sacrificing performance on other safety axes. For instance, adversarial training improves adversarial robustness but sharply degrades other classifier performance metrics. Similarly, strong data augmentation and regularization techniques often improve OOD robustness but harm anomaly detection, raising the question of whether a Pareto improvement on all existing safety measures is possible. To meet this challenge, we design a new data augmentation strategy utilizing the natural structural complexity of pictures such as fractals, which outperforms numerous baselines, is near Pareto-optimal, and roundly improves safety measures.

In this work, we critically examine how the adversarial robustness guarantees from randomized smoothing-based certification methods change when state-of-the-art certifiably robust models encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our analysis demonstrates a previously unknown vulnerability of these models to low-frequency OOD data such as weather-related corruptions, rendering these models unfit for deployment in the wild.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Covariate shift generalization, a typical case in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, requires a good performance on the unknown testing distribution, which varies from the accessible training distribution in the form of covariate shift. Recently, stable learning algorithms have shown empirical effectiveness to deal with covariate shift generalization on several learning models involving regression algorithms and deep neural networks. However, the theoretical explanations for such effectiveness are still missing. In this paper, we take a step further towards the theoretical analysis of stable learning algorithms by explaining them as feature selection processes.

In the field of ReID, we are the first to conduct an exhaustive study on corruption invariant learning in single- and cross-modality datasets, including Market-1501, CUHK03, MSMT17, RegDB, SYSU-MM01. After reproducing and examining the robustness performance of 21 recent ReID methods, we have some observations: 1) transformer-based models are more robust towards corrupted images, compared with CNN-based models, 2) increasing the probability of random erasing (a commonly used augmentation method) hurts model corruption robustness, 3) cross-dataset generalization improves with corruption robustness increases. By analyzing the above observations, we propose a strong baseline on both single- and cross-modality ReID datasets which achieves improved robustness against diverse corruptions.

  - Key Word: Distribution Shifts; Data Augmentation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Robustness to distribution shifts is critical for deploying machine learning models in the real world. Despite this necessity, there has been little work in defining the underlying mechanisms that cause these shifts and evaluating the robustness of algorithms across multiple, different distribution shifts. To this end, we introduce a framework that enables fine-grained analysis of various distribution shifts. We provide a holistic analysis of current state-of-the-art methods by evaluating 19 distinct methods grouped into five categories across both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, we train more than 85K models. Our experimental framework can be easily extended to include new methods, shifts, and datasets. We find, unlike previous work, that progress has been made over a standard ERM baseline; in particular, pretraining and augmentations (learned or heuristic) offer large gains in many cases. However, the best methods are not consistent over different datasets and shifts.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In contrast to prior robustness work that introduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other (un)structured noise, we here recompose, interpolate, or extrapolate only existing factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and medium-sized objects during training and large objects during testing). Models that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards more realistic real-world datasets.

  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Fine-Tuning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Although machine learning models typically experience a drop in performance on out-of-distribution data, accuracies on in- versus out-of-distribution data are widely observed to follow a single linear trend when evaluated across a testbed of models. Models that are more accurate on the out-of-distribution data relative to this baseline exhibit "effective robustness" and are exceedingly rare. Identifying such models, and understanding their properties, is key to improving out-of-distribution performance. We conduct a thorough empirical investigation of effective robustness during fine-tuning and surprisingly find that models pre-trained on larger datasets exhibit effective robustness during training that vanishes at convergence. We study how properties of the data influence effective robustness, and we show that it increases with the larger size, more diversity, and higher example difficulty of the dataset.

We therefore re-purpose the dataset from the Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge 2019 and use a subset of it as a new robustness benchmark (ImageNet-D) which proves to be a more challenging dataset.

Our approach takes the form of a regularization term that trades off between in-distribution performance and robustness to interventions. Under the assumption of a linear structural causal model, we show that a single proxy can be used to create estimators that are prediction optimal under interventions of bounded strength.

- Does Invariant Risk Minimization Capture Invariance? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01134)
  - Pritish Kamath, Akilesh Tangella, Danica J. Sutherland, Nathan Srebro. *AISTATS 2021*
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) formulation of Arjovsky et al. (2019) can fail to capture "natural" invariances, at least when used in its practical "linear" form, and even on very simple problems which directly follow the motivating examples for IRM. This can lead to worse generalization on new environments, even when compared to unconstrained ERM. The issue stems from a significant gap between the linear variant (as in their concrete method IRMv1) and the full non-linear IRM formulation.

- Generative Interventions for Causal Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12265) [[code]](https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/GenInt)
  - Chengzhi Mao, Augustine Cha, Amogh Gupta, Hao Wang, Junfeng Yang, Carl Vondrick. *CVPR 2021*
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Causal Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a framework for learning robust visual representations that generalize to new viewpoints, backgrounds, and scene contexts. Discriminative models often learn naturally occurring spurious correlations, which cause them to fail on images outside of the training distribution. In this paper, we show that we can steer generative models to manufacture interventions on features caused by confounding factors.

- Simulating a Primary Visual Cortex at the Front of CNNs Improves Robustness to Image Perturbations. [[paper]](https://nips.cc/virtual/2020/public/poster_98b17f068d5d9b7668e19fb8ae470841.html) [[code]](https://github.com/dicarlolab/vonenet)

  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Neuroscience.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We developed VOneNets, a new class of hybrid CNN vision models. The VOneBlock is based on a classical neuroscientific model of V1: the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model, consisting of a biologically-constrained Gabor filter bank, simple and complex cell nonlinearities, and a V1 neuronal stochasticity generator. We show that all components of the VOneBlock work in synergy to improve robustness (white box adversarial attack and corruption).

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We explore five classes of remedies in blurring object detection: deblurring, squint, augmentation, using minibatch statistics and label modification.

- StackMix: A complementary Mix algorithm. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12618v2)
  - John Chen, Samarth Sinha, Anastasios Kyrillidis.
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Data Augmentation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present StackMix: Each input is presented as a concatenation of two images, and the label is the mean of the two one-hot labels. We further show that gains hold for robustness to common input corruptions and perturbations at varying severities with a 0.7% improvement on CIFAR-100-C, by combining StackMix with AugMix over AugMix.

- An Effective Anti-Aliasing Approach for Residual Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10675v1)
  - Cristina Vasconcelos, Hugo Larochelle, Vincent Dumoulin, Nicolas Le Roux, Ross Goroshin.
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Anti-Aliasing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that we can mitigate this effect by placing non-trainable blur filters and using smooth activation functions at key locations, particularly where networks lack the capacity to learn them. These simple architectural changes lead to substantial improvements in out-of-distribution generalization on both image classification under natural corruptions on ImageNetC and few-shot learning on Meta-Dataset.

- Learning causal semantic representation for out-of-distribution prediction. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01681)
  - Chang Liu, Xinwei Sun, Jindong Wang , Haoyue Tang, Tao Li, Tao Qin, Wei Chen, and Tie-Yan Liu. *NeurIPS 2021*
  - Key Word: Out-of-distribution generalization; Causality
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a Causal Semantic Generative model (CSG) based on a causal reasoning so that the two factors are modeled separately, and develop methods for OOD prediction from a single training domain, which is common and challenging. The methods are based on the causal invariance principle, with a novel design in variational Bayes for both efficient learning and easy prediction.

- Empirical or Invariant Risk Minimization? A Sample Complexity Perspective. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16412) [[code]](https://github.com/IBM/IRM-games)
  - Kartik Ahuja, Jun Wang, Amit Dhurandhar, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Kush R. Varshney. *ICLR 2021*
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recently, invariant risk minimization (IRM) was proposed as a promising solution to address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. However, it is unclear when IRM should be preferred over the widely-employed empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. In this work, we analyze both these frameworks from the perspective of sample complexity, thus taking a firm step towards answering this important question. We find that depending on the type of data generation mechanism, the two approaches might have very different finite sample and asymptotic behavior.

- Understanding the Failure Modes of Out-of-Distribution Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15775) [[code]](https://github.com/google-research/OOD-failures)
  - Vaishnavh Nagarajan, Anders Andreassen, Behnam Neyshabur. *ICLR 2021*
  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We identify the fundamental factors that give rise to this behavior, by explaining why models fail this way even in easy-to-learn tasks where one would expect these models to succeed. In particular, through a theoretical study of gradient-descent-trained linear classifiers on some easy-to-learn tasks, we uncover two complementary failure modes. These modes arise from how spurious correlations induce two kinds of skews in the data: one geometric in nature and another, statistical.

- Improving Transformation Invariance in Contrastive Representation Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09515) [[code]](https://github.com/ae-foster/invclr)
  - Adam Foster, Rattana Pukdee, Tom Rainforth. *ICLR 2021*
  - Key Word: Transformation Invariance; Contrastive Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first introduce a training objective for contrastive learning that uses a novel regularizer to control how the representation changes under transformation. We show that representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to across the board performance gains.

- Maximum-Entropy Adversarial Data Augmentation for Improved Generalization and Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08001) [[code]](https://github.com/garyzhao/ME-ADA)

  - Elliot Creager, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, Richard Zemel. *ICML 2021*
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality; Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose EIIL, a general framework for domain-invariant learning that incorporates Environment Inference to directly infer partitions that are maximally informative for downstream Invariant Learning. We show that EIIL outperforms invariant learning methods on the CMNIST benchmark without using environment labels, and significantly outperforms ERM on worst-group performance in the Waterbirds and CivilComments datasets. Finally, we establish connections between EIIL and algorithmic fairness, which enables EIIL to improve accuracy and calibration in a fair prediction problem.

  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Shape-Texture.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop a shape-texture debiased neural network training framework to guide CNNs for learning better representations. Our method is a data-driven approach, which let CNNs automatically figure out how to avoid being biased towards either shape or texture from their training samples.

  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present the first analysis of classification under the IRM objective--as well as these recently proposed alternatives--under a fairly natural and general model. In the linear case, we show simple conditions under which the optimal solution succeeds or, more often, fails to recover the optimal invariant predictor.

- Increasing the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation Models with Painting-by-Numbers. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05495)
  - Christoph Kamann, Burkhard Güssefeld, Robin Hutmacher, Jan Hendrik Metzen, Carsten Rother. *ECCV 2020*
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Data Augmentation; Segmentation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our basic idea is to alpha-blend a portion of the RGB training images with faked images, where each class-label is given a fixed, randomly chosen color that is not likely to appear in real imagery. This forces the network to rely more strongly on shape cues. We call this data augmentation technique “Painting-by-Numbers”.

- Revisiting Batch Normalization for Improving Corruption Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03630v4)
  - Philipp Benz, Chaoning Zhang, Adil Karjauv, In So Kweon. *WACV 2021*
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Normalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We interpret corruption robustness as a domain shift and propose to rectify batch normalization (BN) statistics for improving model robustness.

- Batch Normalization Increases Adversarial Vulnerability: Disentangling Usefulness and Robustness of Model Features. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03316)
  - Philipp Benz, Chaoning Zhang, In So Kweon.
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Normalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We conjecture that the increased adversarial vulnerability is caused by BN shifting the model to rely more on non-robust features (NRFs). Our exploration finds that other normalization techniques also increase adversarial vulnerability and our conjecture is also supported by analyzing the model corruption robustness and feature transferability.

- Adversarial and Natural Perturbations for General Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01401)
  - Sadaf Gulshad, Jan Hendrik Metzen, Arnold Smeulders.
  - Key Word: Common Robustness; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We demonstrate that although adversarial training improves the performance of the networks against adversarial perturbations, it leads to drop in the performance for naturally perturbed samples besides clean samples. In contrast, natural perturbations like elastic deformations, occlusions and wave does not only improve the performance against natural perturbations, but also lead to improvement in the performance for the adversarial perturbations.

  - Giambattista Parascandolo, Alexander Neitz, Antonio Orvieto, Luigi Gresele, Bernhard Schölkopf. *ICLR 2021*
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Gradient Alignment.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we investigate the principle that good explanations are hard to vary in the context of deep learning. We show that averaging gradients across examples -- akin to a logical OR of patterns -- can favor memorization and 'patchwork' solutions that sew together different strategies, instead of identifying invariances. To inspect this, we first formalize a notion of consistency for minima of the loss surface, which measures to what extent a minimum appears only when examples are pooled.

  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our approach combines the Mixup augmentation and a new adversarial training algorithm called Targeted Labeling Adversarial Training (TLAT). The idea of TLAT is to interpolate the target labels of adversarial examples with the groundtruth labels.

  - Tete Xiao, Xiaolong Wang, Alexei A. Efros, Trevor Darrell. *ICLR 2021*
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Contrastive Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Current methods introduce inductive bias by encouraging neural networks to be less sensitive to information w.r.t. augmentation, which may help or may hurt. We use a multi-head network with a shared backbone which captures information across each augmentation and alone outperforms all baselines on downstream tasks.

- Informative Dropout for Robust Representation Learning: A Shape-bias Perspective. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04254) [[code]](https://github.com/bfshi/InfoDrop)

  - Key Word: Dropout; Shape-Texture.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work, we attempt at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN's texture bias. Specifically, with inspiration from human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias.

We explore using the RandConv output as training images or mixing it with the original images. We show that a consistency loss can further enforce invariance under texture changes.

- Robust Image Classification Using A Low-Pass Activation Function and DCT Augmentation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09453v1) [[code]](https://github.com/tahmid0007/Low_Pass_ReLU)
  - Md Tahmid Hossain, Shyh Wei Teng, Ferdous Sohel, Guojun Lu.
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Activation Function.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a family of novel AFs with low-pass filtering to improve robustness against HFc (we call it Low-Pass ReLU or LP-ReLU). To deal with LFc, we further enhance the AFs with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based augmentation. LPReLU coupled with DCT augmentation, enables a deep network to tackle a variety of corruptions.

  - Matthew L. Leavitt, Ari S. Morcos.
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Class Selectivity; Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We found that mean class selectivity predicts vulnerability to naturalistic corruptions; networks regularized to have lower levels of class selectivity are more robust to corruption, while networks with higher class selectivity are more vulnerable to corruption, as measured using Tiny ImageNetC and CIFAR10C. In contrast, we found that class selectivity increases robustness to multiple types of gradient-based adversarial attacks.

- In Search of Lost Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01434) [[code]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed)
  - Ishaan Gulrajani, David Lopez-Paz. *ICLR 2021*
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Empirical Study.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> As a first step, we realize that model selection is non-trivial for domain generalization tasks, and we argue that algorithms without a model selection criterion remain incomplete. Next we implement DomainBed, a testbed for domain generalization including seven benchmarks, fourteen algorithms, and three model selection criteria. When conducting extensive experiments using DomainBed we find that when carefully implemented and tuned, ERM outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of average performance.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce three new robustness benchmarks consisting of naturally occurring distribution changes in image style, geographic location, camera operation, and more. Using our benchmarks, we take stock of previously proposed hypotheses for out-of-distribution robustness and put them to the test.

- Risk Variance Penalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07544)
  - Chuanlong Xie, Haotian Ye, Fei Chen, Yue Liu, Rui Sun, Zhenguo Li.
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality; Distributional Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The key of the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is to generalize invariance from training domains to target domains. The variance risk extrapolation (V-REx) is a practical OOD method, which depends on a domain-level regularization but lacks theoretical verifications about its motivation and utility. This article provides theoretical insights into V-REx by studying a variance-based regularizer. We propose Risk Variance Penalization (RVP), which slightly changes the regularization of V-REx but addresses the theory concerns about V-REx.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We combine information-theoretic objective functions with a computational architecture informed by the physiology of the human visual system and unsupervised training on pairs of video frames, yielding our Perceptual Information Metric (PIM). We show that PIM is competitive with supervised metrics on the recent and challenging BAPPS image quality assessment dataset and perform qualitative experiments using the ImageNet-C dataset, and establish that PIM is robust with respect to architectural details.

  - Key Word: Survey; Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Neuroscience.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We seek to distil how many of deep learning's problem can be seen as different symptoms of the same underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in Comparative Psychology, Education and Linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike.

- ObjectNet Dataset: Reanalysis and Correction. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02042) [[code]](https://github.com/aliborji/ObjectNetReanalysis)
  - Ali Borji.
  - Key Word: Dataset; Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We highlight a major problem with their work which is applying object recognizers to the scenes containing multiple objects rather than isolated objects. The latter results in around 20-30% performance gain using our code. Compared with the results reported in the ObjectNet paper, we observe that around 10-15 % of the performance loss can be recovered, without any test time data augmentation.  

- Invariant Rationalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09772) [[code]](https://github.com/code-terminator/invariant_rationalization)
  - Shiyu Chang, Yang Zhang, Mo Yu, Tommi S. Jaakkola.
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality; Mutual Information.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Selective rationalization improves neural network interpretability by identifying a small subset of input features -- the rationale -- that best explains or supports the prediction. A typical rationalization criterion, i.e. maximum mutual information (MMI), finds the rationale that maximizes the prediction performance based only on the rationale. However, MMI can be problematic because it picks up spurious correlations between the input features and the output. Instead, we introduce a game-theoretic invariant rationalization criterion where the rationales are constrained to enable the same predictor to be optimal across different environments.

- Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Risk Extrapolation (REx). [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00688) [[code]](https://github.com/capybaralet/REx_code_release)
  - David Krueger, Ethan Caballero, Joern-Henrik Jacobsen, Amy Zhang, Jonathan Binas, Dinghuai Zhang, Remi Le Priol, Aaron Courville. *ICML 2021*
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality; Robust Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that reducing differences in risk across training domains can reduce a model's sensitivity to a wide range of extreme distributional shifts, including the challenging setting where the input contains both causal and anti-causal elements. We motivate this approach, Risk Extrapolation (REx), as a form of robust optimization over a perturbation set of extrapolated domains (MM-REx), and propose a penalty on the variance of training risks (V-REx) as a simpler variant.

  - Ian Fischer, Alexander A. Alemi.
  - Key Word: Information Bottleneck; Corruption Robustness; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We demonstrate that the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) can improve model robustness. CEB is an easy strategy to implement and works in tandem with data augmentation procedures. We report results of a large scale adversarial robustness study on CIFAR-10, as well as the ImageNet-C Common Corruptions Benchmark, ImageNet-A, and PGD attacks.

  - Kartik Ahuja, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Kush R. Varshney, Amit Dhurandhar. *ICML 2020*
  - Key Word: Invariant Learning; Causality; Game Theory.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We pose such invariant risk minimization as finding the Nash equilibrium of an ensemble game among several environments. By doing so, we develop a simple training algorithm that uses best response dynamics and, in our experiments, yields similar or better empirical accuracy with much lower variance than the challenging bi-level optimization problem of Arjovsky et al. (2019). One key theoretical contribution is showing that the set of Nash equilibria for the proposed game are equivalent to the set of invariant predictors for any finite number of environments, even with nonlinear classifiers and transformations.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set.

  - Key Word: Neural Scaling Laws; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses the progress in adversarially robust deep learning over the past six years, highlighting improvements in accuracy under adversarial perturbations. It questions the sustainability of relying solely on computing power to drive further advances in robustness and proposes scaling laws for adversarial robustness.

Additionally, the paper introduces a publicly available benchmarking framework to support future research in efficient robust deep learning.

- Scaling Laws for Adversarial Attacks on Language Model Activations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02780)
  - Stanislav Fort.
  - Key Word: Activation Adversarial Attacks; Large Language Model; Neural Scaling Laws.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores adversarial attacks on language models by manipulating a small subset of model activations, demonstrating the ability to control the prediction of a significant number of subsequent tokens. They observe a linear scaling relationship between the controlled activations (a) and the maximum number of target tokens (t_max). They also find that the control needed in the input space to influence the output space (attack resistance χ) remains relatively constant across different model sizes. Interestingly, attacks on activations are stronger than attacks on tokens, but both have similar output control capabilities, suggesting a dimensionality mismatch between input and output spaces. This has implications for multi-modal and selected retrieval models, as attacks can target activations, expanding the attack surface.

It questions whether adversarial examples are inevitable and shows that the distribution of data, particularly its concentration in small-volume input space subsets, plays a crucial role in determining classifier robustness. The paper also demonstrates that when data is concentrated in low-dimensional linear subspaces, classifiers can achieve better robustness through the exploitation of data structure, surpassing provable certification methods in specific scenarios.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper focuses on optimizing the Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) for long-tail classification while considering adversarial attacks. It introduces reformulations of the objective function and proposes an inducing algorithm to enhance the robustness of AUC-oriented adversarial training. The key findings include the equivalence of optimizing AdAUC with score-based or instance-wise-loss-based perturbations, the establishment of an explicit error bound for AUC-oriented adversarial training's generalization ability, and the development of a fast SVRG-based gradient descent-ascent algorithm to accelerate the process. Extensive experimental results on five long-tail datasets demonstrate the performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of adversarial transferability, focusing on surrogate aspects. It investigates the phenomenon of little robustness, where models adversarially trained with mildly perturbed adversarial samples serve as better surrogates, and attributes it to a trade-off between model smoothness and gradient similarity. The authors explore the joint effects of these factors and suggest that the degradation of gradient similarity is due to data distribution shift in adversarial training.

  - Key Word: ChatGPT; Reliability; Textual Adversarial Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we perform the first large-scale measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a carefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains. We find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially underperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system roles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's behavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability. We further show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single character change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We believe that our study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's reliability and underscores the need for strengthening the reliability and security of large language models (LLMs).

- Beyond Factuality: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models as Knowledge Generators. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07289)]
  - Liang Chen, Yang Deng, Yatao Bian, Zeyu Qin, Bingzhe Wu, Tat-Seng Chua, Kam-Fai Wong. *EMNLP 2023*
  - Key Word: AI-Generated Content; Factuality; Reliability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Large language models (LLMs) outperform information retrieval techniques for downstream knowledge-intensive tasks when being prompted to generate world knowledge. However, community concerns abound regarding the factuality and potential implications of using this uncensored knowledge. In light of this, we introduce CONNER, a COmpreheNsive kNowledge Evaluation fRamework, designed to systematically and automatically evaluate generated knowledge from six important perspectives -- Factuality, Relevance, Coherence, Informativeness, Helpfulness and Validity. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the generated knowledge from three different types of LLMs on two widely studied knowledge-intensive tasks, i.e., open-domain question answering and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Surprisingly, our study reveals that the factuality of generated knowledge, even if lower, does not significantly hinder downstream tasks. Instead, the relevance and coherence of the outputs are more important than small factual mistakes. Further, we show how to use CONNER to improve knowledge-intensive tasks by designing two strategies: Prompt Engineering and Knowledge Selection. Our evaluation code and LLM-generated knowledge with human annotations will be released to facilitate future research.

- No more Reviewer #2: Subverting Automatic Paper-Reviewer Assignment using Adversarial Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14443)
  - Thorsten Eisenhofer, Erwin Quiring, Jonas Möller, Doreen Riepel, Thorsten Holz, Konrad Rieck. *USENIX Security Symposium 2023*
  - Key Word: Adversarial Attacks; Paper-Reviewer Assignment.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The number of papers submitted to academic conferences is steadily rising in many scientific disciplines. To handle this growth, systems for automatic paper-reviewer assignments are increasingly used during the reviewing process. These systems use statistical topic models to characterize the content of submissions and automate the assignment to reviewers. In this paper, we show that this automation can be manipulated using adversarial learning. We propose an attack that adapts a given paper so that it misleads the assignment and selects its own reviewers. Our attack is based on a novel optimization strategy that alternates between the feature space and problem space to realize unobtrusive changes to the paper.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Weight Averaging.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We decouple the natural generalization and the robust generalization from joint training and formulate different training strategies for each one. Specifically, instead of minimizing a global loss on the expectation over these two generalization errors, we propose a bi-expert framework called Generalist where we simultaneously train base learners with task-aware strategies so that they can specialize in their own fields.

Subsequently, we advance a novel loss function which we show both theoretically as well as empirically to enjoy a certified level of robustness against data evasion and poisoning attacks while ensuring guaranteed generalization. We indicate through careful numerical experiments that our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields SOTA performance in terms of adversarial error loss.

  - Key Word: Data Augmentation; Adversarial Training; Contrastive Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We revisit existing self-AT methods and discover an inherent dilemma that affects self-AT robustness: either strong or weak data augmentations are harmful to self-AT, and a medium strength is insufficient to bridge the gap. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple remedy named DYNACL (Dynamic Adversarial Contrastive Learning). In particular, we propose an augmentation schedule that gradually anneals from a strong augmentation to a weak one to benefit from both extreme cases.

  - Key Word: Robustness Transfer; Rademacher Complexity; Domain Adaptation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent studies demonstrated that the adversarially robust learning under ℓ∞ attack is harder to generalize to different domains than standard domain adaptation. How to transfer robustness across different domains has been a key question in domain adaptation field. To investigate the fundamental difficulty behind adversarially robust domain adaptation (or robustness transfer), we propose to analyze a key complexity measure that controls the cross-domain generalization: the adversarial Rademacher complexity over {symmetric difference hypothesis space HΔH.

In other words, randomization is not necessary for robustness. In many common randomization schemes, the deterministic classifiers with better risk are explicitly described: For example, we show that ensembles of classifiers are more robust than mixtures of classifiers, and randomized smoothing is more robust than input noise injection.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The transferability of adversarial examples across deep neural networks (DNNs) is the crux of many black-box attacks. Many prior efforts have been devoted to improving the transferability via increasing the diversity in inputs of some substitute models. In this paper, by contrast, we opt for the diversity in substitute models and advocate to attack a Bayesian model for achieving desirable transferability. Deriving from the Bayesian formulation, we develop a principled strategy for possible finetuning, which can be combined with many off-the-shelf Gaussian posterior approximations over DNN parameters.

However, it is unclear whether existing robust training methods effectively increase the margin for each vulnerable point during training. To understand this, we propose a continuous-time framework for quantifying the relative speed of the decision boundary with respect to each individual point.

We build upon recent advancements in data-driven ``locally biased smoothing'' to develop classifiers that treat benign and adversarial test data differently. Specifically, we tailor the smoothing operation to the usage of a robust neural network as the source of robustness.

We propose a gray-box approach, enhancing the powerful black-box randomized smoothing technique with white-box knowledge about invariances.

The derivation of the optimal solution connects PAC-Bayesian learning to the geometry of the robust loss surface through a Trace of Hessian (TrH) regularizer that measures the surface flatness. In practice, we restrict the TrH regularizer to the top layer only, which results in an analytical solution to the bound whose computational cost does not depend on the network depth.

Such a dataset benefits the downstream tasks as natural training is much faster than adversarial training, and demonstrates that the desired property of robustness is transferable between models and data. We propose a principled, tri-level optimization to formulate the robust dataset learning problem.

  - Key Word: Provable Adversarial Defenses; Provably Lipschitz Neural Networks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> 1-Lipschitz CNNs are usually designed by enforcing each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all inputs) to prevent the gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. However, their performance often significantly lags behind that of heuristic methods to enforce Lipschitz constraints where the resulting CNN is not provably 1-Lipschitz. In this work, we reduce this gap by introducing (a) a procedure to certify robustness of 1-Lipschitz CNNs by replacing the last linear layer with a 1-hidden layer MLP that significantly improves their performance for both standard and provably robust accuracy, (b) a method to significantly reduce the training time per epoch for Skew Orthogonal Convolution (SOC) layers (>30\% reduction for deeper networks) and (c) a class of pooling layers using the mathematical property that the l2 distance of an input to a manifold is 1-Lipschitz.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first extend the concept of adversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are ''semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves to the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an undoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However, searching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and non-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first adversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states by strategically reducing the search space.

However, the direct combination of AT with existing methods for CLs results in consistent failure, but not on a simple baseline of two-stage training. In this paper, we further explore the phenomenon and identify the underlying challenges of AT with CLs as intractable adversarial optimization and low-quality adversarial examples.

We show that under mild assumptions the universal adversarial example game lacks a pure Nash equilibrium, indicating UAPs' suboptimal transferability across DNN classifiers. To address this issue, we propose Universal Adversarial Directions (UADs) which only fix a universal direction for adversarial perturbations and allow the perturbations' magnitude to be chosen freely across samples.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Chaos Theory.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Neural Networks, being susceptible to adversarial attacks, should face a strict level of scrutiny before being deployed in critical or adversarial applications. This paper uses ideas from Chaos Theory to explain, analyze, and quantify the degree to which Neural Networks are susceptible to or robust against adversarial attacks. Our results show that susceptibility to attack grows significantly with the depth of the model, which has significant safety implications for the design of Neural Networks for production environments. We also demonstrate how to quickly and easily approximate the certified robustness radii for extremely large models, which until now has been computationally infeasible to calculate directly, as well as show a clear relationship between our new susceptibility metric and post-attack accuracy.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Game Theory.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adversarial training is a standard technique for training adversarially robust models. In this paper, we study adversarial training as an alternating best-response strategy in a 2-player zero-sum game. We prove that even in a simple scenario of a linear classifier and a statistical model that abstracts robust vs. non-robust features, the alternating best response strategy of such game may not converge. On the other hand, a unique pure Nash equilibrium of the game exists and is provably robust. We support our theoretical results with experiments, showing the non-convergence of adversarial training and the robustness of Nash equilibrium.

  - Key Word: Certified Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a layer-wise orthogonal training method (LOT) to effectively train 1-Lipschitz convolution layers via parametrizing an orthogonal matrix with an unconstrained matrix. We then efficiently compute the inverse square root of a convolution kernel by transforming the input domain to the Fourier frequency domain. On the other hand, as existing works show that semi-supervised training helps improve empirical robustness, we aim to bridge the gap and prove that semi-supervised learning also improves the certified robustness of Lipschitz-bounded models. 

- On the Adversarial Robustness of Mixture of Experts. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10253)

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Mixture of Experts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recently, Bubeck and Sellke proved a lower bound on the Lipschitz constant of functions that fit the training data in terms of their number of parameters. This raises an interesting open question, do -- and can -- functions with more parameters, but not necessarily more computational cost, have better robustness? We study this question for sparse Mixture of Expert models (MoEs), that make it possible to scale up the model size for a roughly constant computational cost. We theoretically show that under certain conditions on the routing and the structure of the data, MoEs can have significantly smaller Lipschitz constants than their dense counterparts.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We aim to achieve adversarial robustness within larger bounds, against perturbations that may be perceptible, but do not change human (or Oracle) prediction. The presence of images that flip Oracle predictions and those that do not makes this a challenging setting for adversarial robustness. We discuss the ideal goals of an adversarial defense algorithm beyond perceptual limits, and further highlight the shortcomings of naively extending existing training algorithms to higher perturbation bounds. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel defense, Oracle-Aligned Adversarial Training (OA-AT), to align the predictions of the network with that of an Oracle during adversarial training.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Transferability; Face Recognition.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work, instead of performing perturbations on the low-level pixels, we propose to generate attacks through perturbing on the high-level semantics to improve attack transferability. Specifically, a unified flexible framework, Adversarial Attributes (Adv-Attribute), is designed to generate inconspicuous and transferable attacks on face recognition, which crafts the adversarial noise and adds it into different attributes based on the guidance of the difference in face recognition features from the target.

By considering the smallest distance to points on the boundary of a set of certifications this approach improves certifications for more than 80% of Tiny-Imagenet instances, yielding an on average 5% increase in the associated certification.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Transferability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a novel attack method, dubbed reverse adversarial perturbation (RAP). Specifically, instead of minimizing the loss of a single adversarial point, we advocate seeking adversarial example located at a region with unified low loss value, by injecting the worst-case perturbation (the reverse adversarial perturbation) for each step of the optimization procedure. The adversarial attack with RAP is formulated as a min-max bi-level optimization problem.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We empirically analyze a variety of adversarially trained models that achieve high robust accuracies when facing state-of-the-art attacks and we show that AT has an interesting side-effect: it leads to models that are significantly less overconfident with their decisions, even on clean data than non-robust models. Further, our analysis of robust models shows that not only AT but also the model's building blocks (like activation functions and pooling) have a strong influence on the models' prediction confidences.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Neural Tangent Kernel.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show how NTKs allow to generate adversarial examples in a ``training-free'' fashion, and demonstrate that they transfer to fool their finite-width neural net counterparts in the ''lazy'' regime. We leverage this connection to provide an alternative view on robust and non-robust features, which have been suggested to underlie the adversarial brittleness of neural nets. Specifically, we define and study features induced by the eigendecomposition of the kernel to better understand the role of robust and non-robust features, the reliance on both for standard classification and the robustness-accuracy trade-off.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adversarial robustness continues to be a major challenge for deep learning. A core issue is that robustness to one type of attack often fails to transfer to other attacks. While prior work establishes a theoretical trade-off in robustness against different Lp norms, we show that there is potential for improvement against many commonly used attacks by adopting a domain generalisation approach. Concretely, we treat each type of attack as a domain, and apply the Risk Extrapolation method (REx), which promotes similar levels of robustness against all training attacks.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We delve into the robustness of pre-trained models by introducing Pre-trained Adversarial Perturbations (PAPs), which are universal perturbations crafted for the pre-trained models to maintain the effectiveness when attacking fine-tuned ones without any knowledge of the downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a Low-Level Layer Lifting Attack (L4A) method to generate effective PAPs by lifting the neuron activations of low-level layers of the pre-trained models.

  - Key Word: Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting; Adversarial Attack.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We investigate the vulnerability of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models and propose a practical adversarial spatiotemporal attack framework. Specifically, instead of simultaneously attacking all geo-distributed data sources, an iterative gradient-guided node saliency method is proposed to identify the time-dependent set of victim nodes. Furthermore, we devise a spatiotemporal gradient descent based scheme to generate real-valued adversarial traffic states under a perturbation constraint. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the worst performance bound of adversarial traffic forecasting attacks.

  - Key Word: Deep Clustering; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> While traditional clustering approaches have been analyzed from a robustness perspective, no prior work has investigated adversarial attacks and robustness for deep clustering models in a principled manner. To bridge this gap, we propose a blackbox attack using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) where the adversary does not know which deep clustering model is being used, but can query it for outputs. We analyze our attack against multiple state-of-the-art deep clustering models and real-world datasets, and find that it is highly successful. We then employ some natural unsupervised defense approaches, but find that these are unable to mitigate our attack.

  - Shengming Yuan, Qilong Zhang, Lianli Gao, Yaya Cheng, Jingkuan Song. *NeurIPS 2022*
  - Key Word: Unrestricted Color Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Unrestricted color attacks, which manipulate semantically meaningful color of an image, have shown their stealthiness and success in fooling both human eyes and deep neural networks. However, current works usually sacrifice the flexibility of the uncontrolled setting to ensure the naturalness of adversarial examples. As a result, the black-box attack performance of these methods is limited. To boost transferability of adversarial examples without damaging image quality, we propose a novel Natural Color Fool (NCF) which is guided by realistic color distributions sampled from a publicly available dataset and optimized by our neighborhood search and initialization reset.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We derive two fundamental impossibility results that hold for any standard Lipschitz network: one for robust classification on finite datasets, and the other for Lipschitz function approximation. These results identify that networks built upon norm-bounded affine layers and Lipschitz activations intrinsically lose expressive power even in the two-dimensional case, and shed light on how recently proposed Lipschitz networks (e.g., GroupSort and ℓ∞-distance nets) bypass these impossibilities by leveraging order statistic functions.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to quantify how humans perceive visual distortions of digital images without access to their undistorted references. NR-IQA models are extensively studied in computational vision, and are widely used for performance evaluation and perceptual optimization of man-made vision systems. Here we make one of the first attempts to examine the perceptual robustness of NR-IQA models. Under a Lagrangian formulation, we identify insightful connections of the proposed perceptual attack to previous beautiful ideas in computer vision and machine learning.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; On-Manifold Adversarial Examples.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We revisit the off-manifold assumption and want to study a question: at what level is the poor performance of neural networks against adversarial attacks due to on-manifold adversarial examples? Since the true data manifold is unknown in practice, we consider two approximated on-manifold adversarial examples on both real and synthesis datasets. On real datasets, we show that on-manifold adversarial examples have greater attack rates than off-manifold adversarial examples on both standard-trained and adversarially-trained models. On synthetic datasets, theoretically, We prove that on-manifold adversarial examples are powerful, yet adversarial training focuses on off-manifold directions and ignores the on-manifold adversarial examples.

  - Key Word: Weight Decay; Adversarial Robustness; Learning with Label Noise.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce adaptive weight decay, which automatically tunes the hyper-parameter for weight decay during each training iteration. For classification problems, we propose changing the value of the weight decay hyper-parameter on the fly based on the strength of updates from the classification loss (i.e., gradient of cross-entropy), and the regularization loss (i.e., ℓ2-norm of the weights). We show that this simple modification can result in large improvements in adversarial robustness -- an area which suffers from robust overfitting -- without requiring extra data.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper presents the first approach of using generative models for adversarial attacks on multi-object scenes. In order to represent the relationships between different objects in the input scene, we leverage upon the open-sourced pre-trained vision-language model CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), with the motivation to exploit the encoded semantics in the language space along with the visual space. We call this attack approach Generative Adversarial Multi-object scene Attacks (GAMA). GAMA demonstrates the utility of the CLIP model as an attacker's tool to train formidable perturbation generators for multi-object scenes.

We first consider a simple linear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and spurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that (i) adversarial training with ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms increases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For ℓ∞ adversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the spurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial training can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional robustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test domain.

While earlier works have focused on improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when compared to convolutions.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present a minimax optimal learner for the problem of learning predictors robust to adversarial examples at test-time. Interestingly, we find that this requires new algorithmic ideas and approaches to adversarially robust learning. In particular, we show, in a strong negative sense, the suboptimality of the robust learner proposed by Montasser, Hanneke, and Srebro (2019) and a broader family of learners we identify as local learners. Our results are enabled by adopting a global perspective, specifically, through a key technical contribution: the global one-inclusion graph, which may be of independent interest, that generalizes the classical one-inclusion graph due to Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth (1994).

To this end, we first provide convergence guarantees for adversarial coreset selection. In particular, we show that the convergence bound is directly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed over the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we propose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset selection objective to reduce the training set size effectively.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Attacks; Text-Guided Image Generation; Prompting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Text-guided image generation models can be prompted to generate images using nonce words adversarially designed to robustly evoke specific visual concepts. Two approaches for such generation are introduced: macaronic prompting, which involves designing cryptic hybrid words by concatenating subword units from different languages; and evocative prompting, which involves designing nonce words whose broad morphological features are similar enough to that of existing words to trigger robust visual associations. The two methods can also be combined to generate images associated with more specific visual concepts. The implications of these techniques for the circumvention of existing approaches to content moderation, and particularly the generation of offensive or harmful images, are discussed.

  - Xiaoxiao Li, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang.
  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Adversarial Robustness; Convergence via Over-parameterization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We formulate a general form of federated adversarial learning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized setting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate adversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local model parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and broadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and formulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the convergence analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the gradient direction, it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in FAL for three reasons: 1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not updating in the gradient direction due to the multi-local updates on the client-side before aggregation and 3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address these challenges by using appropriate gradient approximation and coupling techniques and present the convergence analysis in the over-parameterized regime.

- Is current research on adversarial robustness addressing the right problem? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00539)
  - Ali Borji.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Short answer: Yes, Long answer: No! Indeed, research on adversarial robustness has led to invaluable insights helping us understand and explore different aspects of the problem. Many attacks and defenses have been proposed over the last couple of years. The problem, however, remains largely unsolved and poorly understood. Here, I argue that the current formulation of the problem serves short term goals, and needs to be revised for us to achieve bigger gains. Specifically, the bound on perturbation has created a somewhat contrived setting and needs to be relaxed. This has misled us to focus on model classes that are not expressive enough to begin with. Instead, inspired by human vision and the fact that we rely more on robust features such as shape, vertices, and foreground objects than non-robust features such as texture, efforts should be steered towards looking for significantly different classes of models.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose transferability from Large Geometric Vicinity (LGV), a new technique to increase the transferability of black-box adversarial attacks. LGV starts from a pretrained surrogate model and collects multiple weight sets from a few additional training epochs with a constant and high learning rate. LGV exploits two geometric properties that we relate to transferability.

To this end, we focus on the attacking utility of all interactions between regional adversarial perturbations, and we first discover and prove the negative correlation between the adversarial transferability and the attacking utility of interactions.

- Calibrated ensembles can mitigate accuracy tradeoffs under distribution shift. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08977)

  - Key Word: Calibration; Distribution Shift.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We find that ID-calibrated ensembles -- where we simply ensemble the standard and robust models after calibrating on only ID data -- outperforms prior state-of-the-art (based on self-training) on both ID and OOD accuracy. On eleven natural distribution shift datasets, ID-calibrated ensembles obtain the best of both worlds: strong ID accuracy and OOD accuracy. We analyze this method in stylized settings, and identify two important conditions for ensembles to perform well both ID and OOD: (1) we need to calibrate the standard and robust models (on ID data, because OOD data is unavailable), (2) OOD has no anticorrelated spurious features.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We explore the difference between the training processes of SAT and FAT and observe that the attack success rate of adversarial examples (AEs) of FAT gets worse gradually in the late training stage, resulting in overfitting. The AEs are generated by the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) with a zero or random initialization. Based on the observation, we propose a prior-guided FGSM initialization method to avoid overfitting after investigating several initialization strategies, improving the quality of the AEs during the whole training process.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Attacks; Visible Watermark Removal; Watermark Protection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> As a common security tool, visible watermarking has been widely applied to protect copyrights of digital images. However, recent works have shown that visible watermarks can be removed by DNNs without damaging their host images. Such watermark-removal techniques pose a great threat to the ownership of images. Inspired by the vulnerability of DNNs on adversarial perturbations, we propose a novel defence mechanism by adversarial machine learning for good. From the perspective of the adversary, blind watermark-removal networks can be posed as our target models; then we actually optimize an imperceptible adversarial perturbation on the host images to proactively attack against watermark-removal networks, dubbed Watermark Vaccine.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a Robust Detector (RobustDet) based on adversarially-aware convolution to disentangle gradients for model learning on clean and adversarial images. RobustDet also employs the Adversarial Image Discriminator (AID) and Consistent Features with Reconstruction (CFR) to ensure a reliable robustness.

  - Key Word: Frequency; Adversarial Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> For black-box attacks, the gap between the substitute model and the victim model is usually large, which manifests as a weak attack performance. Motivated by the observation that the transferability of adversarial examples can be improved by attacking diverse models simultaneously, model augmentation methods which simulate different models by using transformed images are proposed. However, existing transformations for spatial domain do not translate to significantly diverse augmented models. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel spectrum simulation attack to craft more transferable adversarial examples against both normally trained and defense models.

- Not all broken defenses are equal: The dead angles of adversarial accuracy. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04129)
  - Raphael Olivier, Bhiksha Raj.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Many defenses, when evaluated against a strong attack, do not provide accuracy improvements while still contributing partially to adversarial robustness. Popular certification methods suffer from the same issue, as they provide a lower bound to accuracy. To capture finer robustness properties we propose a new metric for L2 robustness, adversarial angular sparsity, which partially answers the question "how many adversarial examples are there around an input". We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating both "strong" and "weak" defenses. We show that some state-of-the-art defenses, delivering very similar accuracy, can have very different sparsity on the inputs that they are not robust on. We also show that some weak defenses actually decrease robustness, while others strengthen it in a measure that accuracy cannot capture.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Defenses; Random Transformation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet. However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties poorly understood. Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First, we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT's evaluation is ineffective and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT defense.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our normalizer-free robust training (NoFrost) method extends recent advances in normalizer-free networks to AT for its unexplored advantage on handling the mixture distribution challenge. We show that NoFrost achieves adversarial robustness with only a minor sacrifice on clean sample accuracy. On ImageNet with ResNet50, NoFrost achieves 74.06% clean accuracy, which drops merely 2.00% from standard training. In contrast, BN-based AT obtains 59.28% clean accuracy, suffering a significant 16.78% drop from standard training.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Data Pruning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We demonstrate data pruning-a method for increasing adversarial training efficiency through data sub-sampling.We empirically show that data pruning leads to improvements in convergence and reliability of adversarial training, albeit with different levels of utility degradation. For example, we observe that using random sub-sampling of CIFAR10 to drop 40% of data, we lose 8% adversarial accuracy against the strongest attackers, while by using only 20% of data we lose 14% adversarial accuracy and reduce runtime by a factor of 3. Interestingly, we discover that in some settings data pruning brings benefits from both worlds-it both improves adversarial accuracy and training time.

- Adversarial Robustness is at Odds with Lazy Training. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00411)
  - Yunjuan Wang, Enayat Ullah, Poorya Mianjy, Raman Arora.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Lazy Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent works show that random neural networks are vulnerable against adversarial attacks [Daniely and Schacham, 2020] and that such attacks can be easily found using a single step of gradient descent [Bubeck et al., 2021]. In this work, we take it one step further and show that a single gradient step can find adversarial examples for networks trained in the so-called lazy regime. This regime is interesting because even though the neural network weights remain close to the initialization, there exist networks with small generalization error, which can be found efficiently using first-order methods. Our work challenges the model of the lazy regime, the dominant regime in which neural networks are provably efficiently learnable. We show that the networks trained in this regime, even though they enjoy good theoretical computational guarantees, remain vulnerable to adversarial examples.

- Increasing Confidence in Adversarial Robustness Evaluations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13991)  
  - Roland S. Zimmermann, Wieland Brendel, Florian Tramer, Nicholas Carlini.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Hundreds of defenses have been proposed to make deep neural networks robust against minimal (adversarial) input perturbations. However, only a handful of these defenses held up their claims because correctly evaluating robustness is extremely challenging: Weak attacks often fail to find adversarial examples even if they unknowingly exist, thereby making a vulnerable network look robust. In this paper, we propose a test to identify weak attacks, and thus weak defense evaluations. Our test slightly modifies a neural network to guarantee the existence of an adversarial example for every sample. Consequentially, any correct attack must succeed in breaking this modified network.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Multimodal Fusion Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We investigate the robustness of multimodal neural networks against worst-case (i.e., adversarial) perturbations on a single modality. We first show that standard multimodal fusion models are vulnerable to single-source adversaries: an attack on any single modality can overcome the correct information from multiple unperturbed modalities and cause the model to fail. This surprising vulnerability holds across diverse multimodal tasks and necessitates a solution. Motivated by this finding, we propose an adversarially robust fusion strategy that trains the model to compare information coming from all the input sources, detect inconsistencies in the perturbed modality compared to the other modalities, and only allow information from the unperturbed modalities to pass through.

They provide a convergence guarantee for the algorithm and present experimental results demonstrating its performance and robustness on long-tail datasets.

  - Key Word: Representational Similarity; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A major challenge in studying robustness in deep learning is defining the set of ``meaningless'' perturbations to which a given Neural Network (NN) should be invariant. Most work on robustness implicitly uses a human as the reference model to define such perturbations. Our work offers a new view on robustness by using another reference NN to define the set of perturbations a given NN should be invariant to, thus generalizing the reliance on a reference ``human NN'' to any NN. This makes measuring robustness equivalent to measuring the extent to which two NNs share invariances, for which we propose a measure called STIR. STIR re-purposes existing representation similarity measures to make them suitable for measuring shared invariances.

We first explore the essential correlations between unguided diffusion models and randomized smoothing, enabling us to apply the models to certified robustness. The empirical results show that our models outperform randomized smoothing by 5% when the certified L2 radius r is larger than 0.5.

  - Key Word: Certified Adversarial Robustness; Randomized Smoothing; Diffusion Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper we show how to achieve state-of-the-art certified adversarial robustness to 2-norm bounded perturbations by relying exclusively on off-the-shelf pretrained models. To do so, we instantiate the denoised smoothing approach of Salman et al. by combining a pretrained denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a standard high-accuracy classifier. This allows us to certify 71% accuracy on ImageNet under adversarial perturbations constrained to be within a 2-norm of 0.5, an improvement of 14 percentage points over the prior certified SoTA using any approach, or an improvement of 30 percentage points over denoised smoothing. We obtain these results using only pretrained diffusion models and image classifiers, without requiring any fine tuning or retraining of model parameters.

The results of large-scale evaluation experiments conducted on the latest robust models show that, for most models, ACG was able to find more adversarial examples with fewer iterations than the existing SOTA algorithm Auto-PGD (APGD).

  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Robust Overfitting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Robust overfitting widely exists in adversarial training of deep networks. The exact underlying reasons for this are still not completely understood. Here, we explore the causes of robust overfitting by comparing the data distribution of non-overfit (weak adversary) and overfitted (strong adversary) adversarial training, and observe that the distribution of the adversarial data generated by weak adversary mainly contain small-loss data. However, the adversarial data generated by strong adversary is more diversely distributed on the large-loss data and the small-loss data. Given these observations, we further designed data ablation adversarial training and identify that some small-loss data which are not worthy of the adversary strength cause robust overfitting in the strong adversary mode. To relieve this issue, we propose minimum loss constrained adversarial training (MLCAT): in a minibatch, we learn large-loss data as usual, and adopt additional measures to increase the loss of the small-loss data.

We introduce block decomposition and history subsampling techniques to improve the scalability of Bayesian optimization when an input sequence becomes long.

Yet the more primitive adversarial attacks might be physically infeasible or require some resources that are hard to access like the training data, which motivated the emergence of patch attacks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview to cover existing techniques of adversarial patch attacks, aiming to help interested researchers quickly catch up with the progress in this field. We also discuss existing techniques for developing detection and defences against adversarial patches, aiming to help the community better understand this field and its applications in the real world.

  - Key Word: Certified Adversarial Robustness; Pruning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Certifiable robustness is a highly desirable property for adopting deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical scenarios, but often demands tedious computations to establish. The main hurdle lies in the massive amount of non-linearity in large DNNs. To trade off the DNN expressiveness (which calls for more non-linearity) and robustness certification scalability (which prefers more linearity), we propose a novel solution to strategically manipulate neurons, by "grafting" appropriate levels of linearity. The core of our proposal is to first linearize insignificant ReLU neurons, to eliminate the non-linear components that are both redundant for DNN performance and harmful to its certification. We then optimize the associated slopes and intercepts of the replaced linear activations for restoring model performance while maintaining certifiability. Hence, typical neuron pruning could be viewed as a special case of grafting a linear function of the fixed zero slopes and intercept, that might overly restrict the network flexibility and sacrifice its performance.

However, this impressive performance raises the question: Are these robustness gains provided by randomized ensembles real? In this work we address this question both theoretically and empirically. We first establish theoretically that commonly employed robustness evaluation methods such as adaptive PGD provide a false sense of security in this setting.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper will describe and analyze a new phenomenon that was not known before, which we call "Early Transferability". Its essence is that the adversarial perturbations transfer among different networks even at extremely early stages in their training. In fact, one can initialize two networks with two different independent choices of random weights and measure the angle between their adversarial perturbations after each step of the training. What we discovered was that these two adversarial directions started to align with each other already after the first few training steps (which typically use only a small fraction of the available training data), even though the accuracy of the two networks hadn't started to improve from their initial bad values due to the early stage of the training.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In the context of adversarial robustness, a single model does not usually have enough power to defend against all possible adversarial attacks, and as a result, has sub-optimal robustness. Consequently, an emerging line of work has focused on learning an ensemble of neural networks to defend against adversarial attacks. In this work, we take a principled approach towards building robust ensembles. We view this problem from the perspective of margin-boosting and develop an algorithm for learning an ensemble with maximum margin.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Entropy Maximization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a complementary regularization strategy that reduces confidence on self-generated examples. The method, which we call RCAD (Reducing Confidence along Adversarial Directions), aims to reduce confidence on out-of-distribution examples lying along directions adversarially chosen to increase training loss. In contrast to adversarial training, RCAD does not try to robustify the model to output the original label, but rather regularizes it to have reduced confidence on points generated using much larger perturbations than in conventional adversarial training.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Geometric and Analytic Modeling.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Many studies investigate the phenomenon by proposing a simplified model of how adversarial examples occur and validate it by predicting some aspect of the phenomenon. While these studies cover many different characteristics of the adversarial examples, they have not reached a holistic approach to the geometric and analytic modeling of the phenomenon. This paper propose a formal framework to study the phenomenon in learning theory and make use of complex analysis and holomorphicity to offer a robust learning rule for artificial neural networks.

To evaluate our method against strong adaptive attacks in an efficient and scalable way, we propose to use the adjoint method to compute full gradients of the reverse generative process.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We methodically revisit the role of noise and clipping in single-step adversarial training. Contrary to previous intuitions, we find that using a stronger noise around the clean sample combined with not clipping is highly effective in avoiding CO for large perturbation radii. Based on these observations, we then propose Noise-FGSM (N-FGSM) that, while providing the benefits of single-step adversarial training, does not suffer from CO. Empirical analyses on a large suite of experiments show that N-FGSM is able to match or surpass the performance of previous single-step methods while achieving a 3× speed-up.

Specifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of noisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the pretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies, MedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting.

- The Dimpled Manifold Model of Adversarial Examples in Machine Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10151)
  - Adi Shamir, Odelia Melamed, Oriel BenShmuel.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a new conceptual framework for how the decision boundary between classes evolves during training, which we call the Dimpled Manifold Model. In particular, we demonstrate that training is divided into two distinct phases. The first phase is a (typically fast) clinging process in which the initially randomly oriented decision boundary gets very close to the low dimensional image manifold, which contains all the training examples. Next, there is a (typically slow) dimpling phase which creates shallow bulges in the decision boundary that move it to the correct side of the training examples. This framework provides a simple explanation for why adversarial examples exist, why their perturbations have such tiny norms, and why they look like random noise rather than like the target class.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Causality.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial examples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of adversarial attacks. From a causal perspective, we find that the label is spuriously correlated with the style (content-independent) information when an instance is given. The spurious correlation implies that the adversarial distribution is constructed via making the statistical conditional association between style information and labels drastically different from that in natural distribution.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We explore the memorization effect in adversarial training (AT) for promoting a deeper understanding of model capacity, convergence, generalization, and especially robust overfitting of the adversarially trained models. We first demonstrate that deep networks have sufficient capacity to memorize adversarial examples of training data with completely random labels, but not all AT algorithms can converge under the extreme circumstance. Our study of AT with random labels motivates further analyses on the convergence and generalization of AT. We find that some AT approaches suffer from a gradient instability issue and most recently suggested complexity measures cannot explain robust generalization by considering models trained on random labels.

The loss deviation term increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input.

We first perform a stress test to reveal the vulnerability of deep representations of medical images, in contrast to natural images. We then theoretically prove that typical adversarial attacks to binary disease diagnosis network manipulate the prediction by continuously optimizing the vulnerable representations in a fixed direction, resulting in outlier features that make medical AEs easy to detect.

We present both experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to illustrate this principle, and a theoretical result proving that for certain natural classification tasks, training a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation using randomly initialized gradient descent indeed satisfies this principle.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Condensed Matter Physics.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We find that some important underlying physical principles and symmetries remain to be adequately captured for classifiers with even near-perfect performance. This explains why adversarial perturbations exist for fooling these classifiers. In addition, we find that, after adversarial training, the classifiers will become more consistent with physical laws and consequently more robust to certain kinds of adversarial perturbations. Our results provide valuable guidance for both theoretical and experimental future studies on applying machine learning techniques to condensed matter physics.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Typically robustness does not generalize to previously unseen threat models, e.g., other Lp norms, or larger perturbations. Our confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) tackles this problem by biasing the model towards low confidence predictions on adversarial examples. By allowing to reject examples with low confidence, robustness generalizes beyond the threat model employed during training.

Specifically, we expose the vulnerability of these models to adversarial examples by proposing the Adaptive Segmentation Mask Attack (ASMA). This novel algorithm makes it possible to craft targeted adversarial examples that come with (1) high intersection-over-union rates between the target adversarial mask and the prediction and (2) with perturbation that is, for the most part, invisible to the bare eye.

This inspires us to restrict most of the forward and back propagation within the first layer of the network during adversary updates.

To this end, non-local context encoder (NLCE) is proposed to model short- and long range spatial dependencies and encode global contexts for strengthening feature activations by channel-wise attention. The NLCE modules enhance the robustness and accuracy of the non-local context encoding network (NLCEN), which learns robust enhanced pyramid feature representations with NLCE modules, and then integrates the information across different levels.

We show such excessive invariance occurs across various tasks and architecture types.

A challenge of trigger inversion is that there are many ways of constructing the trigger. Existing methods cannot generalize to various types of triggers by making certain assumptions or attack-specific constraints. The fundamental reason is that existing work does not consider the trigger's design space in their formulation of the inversion problem. This work formally defines and analyzes the triggers injected in different spaces and the inversion problem.

  - Key Word: Trojan Attacks; Diffusion Models. *CVPR 2023*
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We aim to explore the vulnerabilities of diffusion models under potential training data manipulations and try to answer: How hard is it to perform Trojan attacks on well-trained diffusion models? What are the adversarial targets that such Trojan attacks can achieve? To answer these questions, we propose an effective Trojan attack against diffusion models, TrojDiff, which optimizes the Trojan diffusion and generative processes during training.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose CleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned spurious associations introduced by backdoor attacks by re-aligning the representations for individual modalities independently. CleanCLIP can be employed for both unsupervised finetuning on paired image-text data and for supervised finetuning on labeled image data.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Existing defenses are essentially vulnerable in practice when poisoning more samples remains a feasible option for attackers. To address this issue, we leverage timestamps denoting the birth dates of data, which are often available but neglected in the past. Benefiting from these timestamps, we propose a temporal threat model of data poisoning and derive two novel metrics, earliness and duration, which respectively measure how long an attack started in advance and how long an attack lasted.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that merely considering the majority vote in ensemble defenses is wasteful as it does not effectively utilize available information in the logits layers of the base models. Instead, we propose Run-Off Election (ROE), a novel aggregation method based on a two-round election across the base models: In the first round, models vote for their preferred class and then a second, Run-Off election is held between the top two classes in the first round.

- Hidden Poison: Machine Unlearning Enables Camouflaged Poisoning Attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10717) [[code]](https://github.com/jimmy-di/camouflage-poisoning)
  - Jimmy Z. Di, Jack Douglas, Jayadev Acharya, Gautam Kamath, Ayush Sekhari.
  - Key Word: Poisoning Attacks; Machine Unlearning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce camouflaged data poisoning attacks, a new attack vector that arises in the context of machine unlearning and other settings when model retraining may be induced. An adversary first adds a few carefully crafted points to the training dataset such that the impact on the model's predictions is minimal. The adversary subsequently triggers a request to remove a subset of the introduced points at which point the attack is unleashed and the model's predictions are negatively affected.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that fine-tuning, one of the most common and easy-to-adopt machine learning training operations, can effectively remove backdoors from machine learning models while maintaining high model utility. Extensive experiments over three machine learning paradigms show that fine-tuning and our newly proposed super-fine-tuning achieve strong defense performance.

  - Key Word: Backdoor Defenses; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We theoretically analyze the connection among cross-entropy loss, attack success rate, and clean accuracy in this setting.

  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Poisoning Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose FedRecover, which can recover an accurate global model from poisoning attacks with small cost for the clients. Our key idea is that the server estimates the clients' model updates instead of asking the clients to compute and communicate them during the recovery process. In particular, the server stores the global models and clients' model updates in each round, when training the poisoned global model. During the recovery process, the server estimates a client's model update in each round using its stored historical information.

  - Key Word: Poisoning Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose an efficient defense mechanism that significantly reduces the success rate of various data poisoning attacks, and provides theoretical guarantees for the performance of the model. Targeted attacks work by adding bounded perturbations to a randomly selected subset of training data to match the targets' gradient or representation. We show that: (i) under bounded perturbations, only a number of poisons can be optimized to have a gradient that is close enough to that of the target and make the attack successful; (ii) such effective poisons move away from their original class and get isolated in the gradient space; (iii) dropping examples in low-density gradient regions during training can successfully eliminate the effective poisons, and guarantees similar training dynamics to that of training on full data.

  - Key Word: Poisoning Attacks; Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the poisoning scenario where the attacker can insert a small fraction of samples into training data, with arbitrary sensitive attributes as well as other predictive features. We demonstrate that the fairly trained classifiers can be greatly vulnerable to such poisoning attacks, with much worse accuracy & fairness trade-off, even when we apply some of the most effective defenses (originally proposed to defend traditional classification tasks).

  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Existing attacks do not account for future behaviors of other users, and thus require many sequential updates and their effects are quickly erased. We propose an attack that anticipates and accounts for the entire federated learning pipeline, including behaviors of other clients, and ensures that backdoors are effective quickly and persist even after multiple rounds of community updates. 

- Marksman Backdoor: Backdoor Attacks with Arbitrary Target Class. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09194)
  - Khoa D. Doan, Yingjie Lao, Ping Li. *NeurIPS 2022*
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper exploits a novel backdoor attack with a much more powerful payload, denoted as Marksman, where the adversary can arbitrarily choose which target class the model will misclassify given any input during inference. To achieve this goal, we propose to represent the trigger function as a class-conditional generative model and to inject the backdoor in a constrained optimization framework, where the trigger function learns to generate an optimal trigger pattern to attack any target class at will while simultaneously embedding this generative backdoor into the trained model. 

- Trap and Replace: Defending Backdoor Attacks by Trapping Them into an Easy-to-Replace Subnetwork. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06428)

  - Key Word: Backdoor Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a brand-new backdoor defense strategy, which makes it much easier to remove the harmful influence of backdoor samples from the model. Our defense strategy, Trap and Replace, consists of two stages. In the first stage, we bait and trap the backdoors in a small and easy-to-replace subnetwork.  In the second stage, we replace the poisoned light-weighted classification head with an untainted one, by re-training it from scratch only on a small holdout dataset with clean samples, while fixing the stem network. 

- Few-shot Backdoor Attacks via Neural Tangent Kernels. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05929)
  - Jonathan Hayase, Sewoong Oh.
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Neural Tangent Kernel.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In a backdoor attack, an attacker injects corrupted examples into the training set. The goal of the attacker is to cause the final trained model to predict the attacker's desired target label when a predefined trigger is added to test inputs. Central to these attacks is the trade-off between the success rate of the attack and the number of corrupted training examples injected. We pose this attack as a novel bilevel optimization problem: construct strong poison examples that maximize the attack success rate of the trained model. We use neural tangent kernels to approximate the training dynamics of the model being attacked and automatically learn strong poison examples.

  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Masked Image Modeling.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We are the first to systematically threat modeling on SSL in every phase of the model supply chain, i.e., pre-training, release, and downstream phases. Our evaluation shows that models built with MIM are vulnerable to existing backdoor attacks in release and downstream phases and are compromised by our proposed method in pre-training phase. For instance, on CIFAR10, the attack success rate can reach 99.62%, 96.48%, and 98.89% in the downstream phase, release phase, and pre-training phase, respectively.

  - Key Word: Poisoning Defenses; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We aim to bridge the gap by proposing FLCert, an ensemble federated learning framework, that is provably secure against poisoning attacks with a bounded number of malicious clients. Our key idea is to divide the clients into groups, learn a global model for each group of clients using any existing federated learning method, and take a majority vote among the global models to classify a test input.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We instead focus on answering two questions: (1) Is the linguistic modality also vulnerable to poisoning attacks? and (2) Which modality is most vulnerable? To answer the two questions, we conduct three types of poisoning attacks against CLIP, the most representative multimodal contrastive learning framework.

  - Key Word: Data Augmentation; Backdoor Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present three backdoor attacks that can be covertly inserted into data augmentation. Our attacks each insert a backdoor using a different type of computer vision augmentation transform, covering simple image transforms, GAN-based augmentation, and composition-based augmentation. By inserting the backdoor using these augmentation transforms, we make our backdoors difficult to detect, while still supporting arbitrary backdoor functionality.

By performing systematic analysis and exploration on the important design knobs, we propose a framework that can learn the proper trigger patterns, model parameters and pruning masks in an efficient way. Thereby achieving high trigger stealthiness, high attack success rate and high model efficiency simultaneously.

- Lethal Dose Conjecture on Data Poisoning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03309)
  - Wenxiao Wang, Alexander Levine, Soheil Feizi.
  - Key Word: Data poisoning; Deep Partition Aggregation; Finite Aggregation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and its extension, Finite Aggregation (FA) are recent approaches for provable defenses against data poisoning, where they predict through the majority vote of many base models trained from different subsets of training set using a given learner. The conjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal -- if we have the most data-efficient learner, they can turn it into one of the most robust defenses against data poisoning. This outlines a practical approach to developing stronger defenses against poisoning via finding data-efficient learners.

- Data-free Backdoor Removal based on Channel Lipschitzness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03111) [[code]](https://github.com/rkteddy/channel-Lipschitzness-based-pruning)
  - Runkai Zheng, Rongjun Tang, Jianze Li, Li Liu. *ECCV 2022*
  - Key Word: Backdoor Defense; Lipschitz Constant; Model pruning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a novel concept called Channel Lipschitz Constant (CLC), which is defined as the Lipschitz constant of the mapping from the input images to the output of each channel. Then we provide empirical evidences to show the strong correlation between an Upper bound of the CLC (UCLC) and the trigger-activated change on the channel activation. Since UCLC can be directly calculated from the weight matrices, we can detect the potential backdoor channels in a data-free manner, and do simple pruning on the infected DNN to repair the model.

  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Object Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our method constructs the poisoned dataset by rotating a limited amount of objects and labeling them incorrectly; once trained with it, the victim's model will make undesirable predictions during run-time inference. It exhibits a significantly high attack success rate while maintaining clean performance through comprehensive empirical studies on image classification and object detection tasks.

  - Key Word: Poisoning Attacks; Federated Learning; Medical Imaging; Healthcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a robust aggregation rule called Distance-based Outlier Suppression (DOS) that is resilient to byzantine failures. The proposed method computes the distance between local parameter updates of different clients and obtains an outlier score for each client using Copula-based Outlier Detection (COPOD). The resulting outlier scores are converted into normalized weights using a softmax function, and a weighted average of the local parameters is used for updating the global model.

- When does Bias Transfer in Transfer Learning? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842) [[code]](https://github.com/MadryLab/bias-transfer)
  - Hadi Salman, Saachi Jain, Andrew Ilyas, Logan Engstrom, Eric Wong, Aleksander Madry.
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Bias Transfer.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Using transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained "source model" to a downstream "target task" can dramatically increase performance with seemingly no downside. In this work, we demonstrate that there can exist a downside after all: bias transfer, or the tendency for biases of the source model to persist even after adapting the model to the target class. Through a combination of synthetic and natural experiments, we show that bias transfer both (a) arises in realistic settings (such as when pre-training on ImageNet or other standard datasets) and (b) can occur even when the target dataset is explicitly de-biased.

- Backdoor Attack is A Devil in Federated GAN-based Medical Image Synthesis. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00762)
  - Ruinan Jin, Xiaoxiao Li.
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Federated Learning; Generative Adversarial Nets; Medical Image; Healthcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a way of attacking federated GAN (FedGAN) by treating the discriminator with a commonly used data poisoning strategy in backdoor attack classification models. We demonstrate that adding a small trigger with size less than 0.5 percent of the original image size can corrupt the FL-GAN model. Based on the proposed attack, we provide two effective defense strategies: global malicious detection and local training regularization.

- BackdoorBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Backdoor Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12654) [[code]](https://github.com/sclbd/backdoorbench)
  - Baoyuan Wu, Hongrui Chen, Mingda Zhang, Zihao Zhu, Shaokui Wei, Danni Yuan, Chao Shen, Hongyuan Zha.
  - Key Word: Backdoor Learning; Benchmark.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We find that the evaluations of new methods are often unthorough to verify their claims and real performance, mainly due to the rapid development, diverse settings, as well as the difficulties of implementation and reproducibility. Without thorough evaluations and comparisons, it is difficult to track the current progress and design the future development roadmap of the literature. To alleviate this dilemma, we build a comprehensive benchmark of backdoor learning, called BackdoorBench. It consists of an extensible modular based codebase (currently including implementations of 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack and 9 SOTA defense algorithms), as well as a standardized protocol of a complete backdoor learning. We also provide comprehensive evaluations of every pair of 8 attacks against 9 defenses, with 5 poisoning ratios, based on 5 models and 4 datasets, thus 8,000 pairs of evaluations in total.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We establish the first private robustness check that uses high break point rank-based statistics on aggregated model updates. By exploiting randomized clustering, we significantly improve the scalability of our defense without compromising privacy. We leverage the derived statistical bounds in zero-knowledge proofs to detect and remove malicious updates without revealing the private user updates. Our novel framework, zPROBE, enables Byzantine resilient and secure federated learning.

- Natural Backdoor Datasets. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10673) [[code]](https://github.com/uchicago-sandlab/naturalbackdoors)
  - Emily Wenger, Roma Bhattacharjee, Arjun Nitin Bhagoji, Josephine Passananti, Emilio Andere, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y. Zhao.
  - Key Word: Natural Backdoor Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Extensive literature on backdoor poison attacks has studied attacks and defenses for backdoors using "digital trigger patterns." In contrast, "physical backdoors" use physical objects as triggers, have only recently been identified, and are qualitatively different enough to resist all defenses targeting digital trigger backdoors. Research on physical backdoors is limited by access to large datasets containing real images of physical objects co-located with targets of classification. Building these datasets is time- and labor-intensive. This works seeks to address the challenge of accessibility for research on physical backdoor attacks. We hypothesize that there may be naturally occurring physically co-located objects already present in popular datasets such as ImageNet. Once identified, a careful relabeling of these data can transform them into training samples for physical backdoor attacks. We propose a method to scalably identify these subsets of potential triggers in existing datasets, along with the specific classes they can poison.

- Neurotoxin: Durable Backdoors in Federated Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10341)
  - Zhengming Zhang, Ashwinee Panda, Linyue Song, Yaoqing Yang, Michael W. Mahoney, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Kannan Ramchandran, Prateek Mittal. *ICML 2022*
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Prior work has shown that backdoors can be inserted into FL models, but these backdoors are often not durable, i.e., they do not remain in the model after the attacker stops uploading poisoned updates. Thus, since training typically continues progressively in production FL systems, an inserted backdoor may not survive until deployment. Here, we propose Neurotoxin, a simple one-line modification to existing backdoor attacks that acts by attacking parameters that are changed less in magnitude during training.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We are the first to show that ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. We also find an intriguing difference between ViTs and CNNs - interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on test images for ViTs but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we propose a test-time image blocking defense for ViTs which reduces the attack success rate by a large margin.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce autoregressive (AR) poisoning, a method that can generate poisoned data without access to the broader dataset. The proposed AR perturbations are generic, can be applied across different datasets, and can poison different architectures. Compared to existing unlearnable methods, our AR poisons are more resistant against common defenses such as adversarial training and strong data augmentations. Our analysis further provides insight into what makes an effective data poison.

  - Key Word: Backdoor Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary>  We reveal that poisoned samples tend to cluster together in the feature space of the attacked DNN model, which is mostly due to the end-to-end supervised training paradigm. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel backdoor defense via decoupling the original end-to-end training process into three stages. Specifically, we first learn the backbone of a DNN model via self-supervised learning based on training samples without their labels.

This formulation encompasses much of prior work on backdoor removal. We propose the Implicit Backdoor Adversarial Unlearning (I-BAU) algorithm to solve the minimax. Unlike previous work, which breaks down the minimax into separate inner and outer problems, our algorithm utilizes the implicit hypergradient to account for the interdependence between inner and outer optimization.

BadPre can launch trojan attacks against different language tasks with the same trigger. The key insight of our approach is that downstream models can inherit the security characteristics from the pre-trained models.

- How to Inject Backdoors with Better Consistency: Logit Anchoring on Clean Data. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01300)
  - Zhiyuan Zhang, Lingjuan Lyu, Weiqiang Wang, Lichao Sun, Xu Sun. *ICLR 2022*
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Weight Perturbations.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Previous work finds that backdoors can be injected into a trained clean model with Adversarial Weight Perturbation (AWP), which means the variation of parameters are small in backdoor learning. In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon that the variations of parameters are always AWPs when tuning the trained clean model to inject backdoors. We further provide theoretical analysis to explain this phenomenon. We are the first to formulate the behavior of maintaining accuracy on clean data as the consistency of backdoored models, which includes both global consistency and instance-wise consistency.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Multimodal contrastive learning methods like CLIP train on noisy and uncurated training datasets. This is cheaper than labeling datasets manually, and even improves out-of-distribution robustness. We show that this practice makes backdoor and poisoning attacks a significant threat. By poisoning just 0.01% of a dataset (e.g., just 300 images of the 3 million-example Conceptual Captions dataset), we can cause the model to misclassify test images by overlaying a small patch.

  - Key Word: Self-Supervised Learning; Backdoor Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> State-of-the-art self-supervised methods for learning representations from images (e.g., MoCo, BYOL, MSF) use an inductive bias that random augmentations (e.g., random crops) of an image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are vulnerable to backdoor attacks - where an attacker poisons a small part of the unlabeled data by adding a trigger (image patch chosen by the attacker) to the images. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time

  - Key Word: Backdoor Attack.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The trigger injection function is manually defined in most existing backdoor attack methods, e.g., placing a small patch of pixels on an image or slightly deforming the image before poisoning the model. This results in a two-stage approach with a sub-optimal attack success rate and a lack of complete stealthiness under human inspection. In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack framework, LIRA, which jointly learns the optimal, stealthy trigger injection function and poisons the model. We formulate such an objective as a non-convex, constrained optimization problem. Under this optimization framework, the trigger generator function will learn to manipulate the input with imperceptible noise to preserve the model performance on the clean data and maximize the attack success rate on the poisoned data.

We discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small "pockets" are formed around the target sample. Based on this observation, we propose a novel defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by "wrapping" them into a tight convex hull in the feature space. We design an effective algorithm to search for such a convex hull and remove the backdoor by fine-tuning the model using the identified malicious samples with the corrected label according to the convex hull.

  - Key Word: Backdoor Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We tackle the convolution neural networks (CNNs) backdoor detection problem by proposing a new representation called one-pixel signature. Our task is to detect/classify if a CNN model has been maliciously inserted with an unknown Trojan trigger or not. Here, each CNN model is associated with a signature that is created by generating, pixel-by-pixel, an adversarial value that is the result of the largest change to the class prediction. The one-pixel signature is agnostic to the design choice of CNN architectures, and how they were trained. It can be computed efficiently for a black-box CNN model without accessing the network parameters.

We show how a blind attack can evade any known defense and propose new ones.

  - Key Word: Private Transfer Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores the theoretical implications of incorporating public data into differentially private learning for transfer learning scenarios in linear regression. It investigates two scenarios where public and private tasks share a low-rank subspace. In the first scenario, a single model is learned and shared across users, achieving optimal performance within a specific class of algorithms. In the second scenario, with enough public data, users can perform local learning within the subspace without the need for private coordination, achieving the same utility. These findings provide insights into the advantages of using public data in private transfer learning.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper investigates the safety implications of large language models (LLMs) learning from third-party custom finetuning data containing unsafe content. It finds that while LLMs can readily learn unsafe content, they tend to forget it more significantly when subsequently finetuned on safer content. To address this, the "ForgetFilter" algorithm is introduced, which filters unsafe data based on the model's forgetting signal. The algorithm ensures safety in customized finetuning without compromising task performance and outperforms alternative strategies in curbing LLMs' assimilation of unsafe content.

  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Membership Inference Attacks; Neural Tangent Kernel.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper investigates the impact of model over-parameterization in randomized machine learning algorithms on data privacy. It establishes a privacy bound for the KL divergence between model distributions on neighboring datasets, showing that this bound is influenced by factors like initialization, width, and depth of neural networks. The analysis reveals that privacy is closely related to the squared gradient norm during training. Notably, for linearized networks, privacy loss is linked to the per-layer variance of initialization distribution. The study demonstrates that privacy can improve with increased depth under certain initializations but deteriorates with others, highlighting the complex relationship between privacy and depth influenced by initialization. The paper also discusses the trade-off between privacy and utility under a fixed privacy budget.

The paper introduces a method called "Min-K% Prob" for detecting whether a given text was part of the LLM's pretraining data. It leverages the hypothesis that unseen examples contain outlier words with low probabilities under the LLM. This method does not require prior knowledge of the pretraining corpus or additional training, distinguishing it from previous detection techniques. Experiments show that Min-K% Prob outperforms previous methods, with a 7.4% improvement on the benchmark. The method is effectively applied to detect copyrighted content and contaminated downstream examples in real-world scenarios.

This paper introduces two paradigms: 1) "prune first, then unlearn" integrates a sparse model prior to the unlearning process. 2) "sparsity-aware unlearning" (l1-sparse) incorporates sparsity regularization to improve the unlearning process. In experiments, these approaches achieve a significant increase in unlearning performance. Additionally, the paper illustrates the broader applicability of their methods in machine learning, such as defense against backdoor attacks and improvements in transfer learning.

  - Key Word: Large Language Model; Machine Unlearning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper investigates unlearning undesirable behaviors in large language models (LLMs). It identifies three scenarios where unlearning can align LLMs with human preferences: removing harmful responses, erasing copyrighted content, and eliminating hallucinations. Unlearning offers advantages, as it only requires negative examples, making it easier to collect than positive examples used in RLHF. It is computationally efficient and especially effective when the problematic training samples are known. This research is among the first to explore LLM unlearning and introduces settings, goals, and evaluations for this purpose. Despite using only negative samples, the study shows that unlearning can achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with significantly less computational time.

Instead, it provides training instances with modified labels and additional correctly labeled data when making predictions. Experimental results show that this method effectively removes specific information from the training data while maintaining competitive performance compared to existing unlearning methods that rely on model parameter access.

The authors propose a novel technique for "unlearning" specific data from an LLM, without requiring a complete retraining. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by removing the ability of a model to generate or recall Harry Potter-related content while preserving its performance on standard benchmarks. The method involves three main components: a reinforced model to identify relevant tokens, replacing idiosyncratic expressions with generic alternatives, and fine-tuning the model on these alternatives. This paper presents the first effective technique for unlearning in generative language models.

The authors introduce a new metric to identify which data points benefit more from such algorithms compared to standard SGD.

This leads to the discovery of higher privacy risks associated with SAM, which are empirically verified. The paper also suggests strategies to balance accuracy and privacy tradeoffs more effectively.

- Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17410)
  - Vaidehi Patil, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal.
  - Key Word: Large Language Models; Extraction Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses concerns about pretrained language models retaining sensitive and harmful information. The authors propose an attack-and-defense framework for directly deleting such information from model weights. They focus on this approach to ensure that deleted data cannot be extracted by future attacks and to protect against whitebox attacks. Experimental results show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods struggle to completely delete information from models like GPT-J, with attacks successfully recovering "deleted" information 38% of the time. The paper also introduces new defense methods, but no single method proves universally effective. The findings highlight the challenge of truly deleting sensitive information from language models and emphasize its societal implications for real-world deployment.

  - Ruinan Jin, Minghui Chen, Qiong Zhang, Xiaoxiao Li.
  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Federated Learning; Linearized Neural Networks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study focuses on federated learning (FL), a distributed learning framework that allows collaborative model training without sharing data. The authors specifically investigate the "forgettable FL" paradigm, where the global model should not reveal any information about a client it has never encountered. They propose the Forgettable Federated Linear Learning (2F2L) framework, which incorporates novel training and data removal strategies. The framework employs linear approximation to enable deep neural networks to work within the FL setting, achieving comparable results to standard neural network training. They also introduce FedRemoval, an efficient removal strategy that addresses computational challenges by approximating the Hessian matrix using public server data. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for their method, bounding the differences in model weights between FedRemoval and retraining from scratch. Experimental results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in achieving a balance between model accuracy and information removal, outperforming baseline strategies and approaching retraining from scratch.

  - Key Word: Privacy Auditting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a scheme for auditing differentially private machine learning systems with a single training run. This exploits the parallelism of being able to add or remove multiple training examples independently. We analyze this using the connection between differential privacy and statistical generalization, which avoids the cost of group privacy. Our auditing scheme requires minimal assumptions about the algorithm and can be applied in the black-box or white-box setting.

  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Benchmarks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Differential privacy (DP) is a standard for privacy protection and differentially private machine learning (DPML) is important with powerful machine learning techniques. DP-SGD is a classic DPML algorithm that incurs significant utility loss, limiting its practical deployment. Recent studies propose improved algorithms based on DP-SGD, but there is a lack of comprehensive research to measure improvements in DPML algorithms across utility, defensive capabilities, and generalizability. To address this, we perform a holistic measurement of improved DPML algorithms on utility and defense capability against membership inference attacks (MIAs) on image classification tasks. Our results show that sensitivity-bounding techniques are important in defense and we explore some improvements that can maintain model utility and defend against MIAs more effectively.

- On User-Level Private Convex Optimization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04912)
  - Badih Ghazi, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Raghu Meka, Pasin Manurangsi, Chiyuan Zhang.
  - Key Word: Differential Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a new mechanism for stochastic convex optimization (SCO) with user-level differential privacy guarantees. The convergence rates of this mechanism are similar to those in the prior work of Levy et al. (2021); Narayanan et al. (2022), but with two important improvements. Our mechanism does not require any smoothness assumptions on the loss. Furthermore, our bounds are also the first where the minimum number of users needed for user-level privacy has no dependence on the dimension and only a logarithmic dependence on the desired excess error. The main idea underlying the new mechanism is to show that the optimizers of strongly convex losses have low local deletion sensitivity, along with an output perturbation method for functions with low local deletion sensitivity, which could be of independent interest.

In particular, our contributions are two-fold: 1) We analyze the optimization objective of SOTA MI algorithms, argue that the objective is sub-optimal for achieving MI, and propose an improved optimization objective that boosts attack performance significantly. 2) We analyze "MI overfitting", show that it would prevent reconstructed images from learning semantics of training data, and propose a novel "model augmentation" idea to overcome this issue.

Specifically, DMs generate samples from longer tracks and may have newly designed multimodal structures, necessitating the modification of conventional watermarking pipelines. To this end, we conduct comprehensive analyses and derive a recipe for efficiently watermarking state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion), via training from scratch or finetuning.

CUDA is generated using controlled class-wise convolutions with filters that are randomly generated via a private key.

We develop some theoretical analysis demonstrating that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian mixture data by reducing the clean data performance of the optimal Bayes classifier.

- Why Is Public Pretraining Necessary for Private Model Training? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09483)
  - Key Word: Pretraining; Differential Privacy; Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In the privacy-utility tradeoff of a model trained on benchmark language and vision tasks, remarkable improvements have been widely reported with the use of pretraining on publicly available data. This is in part due to the benefits of transfer learning, which is the standard motivation for pretraining in non-private settings. However, the stark contrast in the improvement achieved through pretraining under privacy compared to non-private settings suggests that there may be a deeper, distinct cause driving these gains. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that the non-convex loss landscape of a model training necessitates an optimization algorithm to go through two phases.

- From Robustness to Privacy and Back. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01855)
  - Hilal Asi, Jonathan Ullman, Lydia Zakynthinou.
  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the relationship between two desiderata of algorithms in statistical inference and machine learning: differential privacy and robustness to adversarial data corruptions. Their conceptual similarity was first observed by Dwork and Lei (STOC 2009), who observed that private algorithms satisfy robustness, and gave a general method for converting robust algorithms to private ones. However, all general methods for transforming robust algorithms into private ones lead to suboptimal error rates. Our work gives the first black-box transformation that converts any adversarially robust algorithm into one that satisfies pure differential privacy.

We then empirically study the characteristics of this attack on two-layer networks and reveal that its success heavily depends on deviations from the frozen infinite-width Neural Tangent Kernel limit. More importantly, we formally show for the first time that dataset reconstruction attacks are a variation of dataset distillation.

The motivations of this notion are grounded in the privacy risks imposed by the adoption of learning models in consequential domains, by the significant efforts required by organizations to verify the accuracy of the released information, and align with the data minimization principle outlined in the GDPR

  - Key Word: Survey; Privacy Attacks; Membership Inference Attacks; Attribute Inference Attacks; Property Inference Attacks; Data Reconstruction.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Deploying machine learning models in production may allow adversaries to infer sensitive information about training data. There is a vast literature analyzing different types of inference risks, ranging from membership inference to reconstruction attacks. Inspired by the success of games (i.e., probabilistic experiments) to study security properties in cryptography, some authors describe privacy inference risks in machine learning using a similar game-based style. However, adversary capabilities and goals are often stated in subtly different ways from one presentation to the other, which makes it hard to relate and compose results. In this paper, we present a game-based framework to systematize the body of knowledge on privacy inference risks in machine learning.

  - Key Word: Memorization; Noisy Label.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Deep neural networks may easily memorize noisy labels present in real-world data, which degrades their ability to generalize. It is therefore important to track and evaluate the robustness of models against noisy label memorization. We propose a metric, called susceptibility, to gauge such memorization for neural networks. Susceptibility is simple and easy to compute during training.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show the possibility of jointly training a target model (to be run at users' side) and an attack model for data reconstruction (to be secretly used at server's side). We introduce the ''reconstruction risk'': a new measure for assessing the quality of reconstructed data that better captures the privacy risk of such attacks. Experimental results on 6 benchmark datasets show that for low-complexity data types, or for tasks with larger number of classes, a user's personal data can be approximately reconstructed from the outputs of a single target inference task.

  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Automatic Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We establish a simple connection between robust and differentially-private algorithms: private mechanisms which perform well with very high probability are automatically robust in the sense that they retain accuracy even if a constant fraction of the samples they receive are adversarially corrupted. Since optimal mechanisms typically achieve these high success probabilities, our results imply that optimal private mechanisms for many basic statistics problems are robust.

As part of our platform, we introduce secure compressed multiset aggregation (SCMA), which is of independent interest for secure sparse model aggregation.

We utilize different variants of the celebrated Fano's inequality to derive upper bounds on the inferential power of a data reconstruction adversary when the model is trained differentially privately. Importantly, we show that if the underlying private data takes values from a set of size M, then the target privacy parameter ϵ can be O(logM) before the adversary gains significant inferential power.

The authors of DI provided a correctness proof for linear (suspect) models. However, in the same setting, we prove that DI suffers from high false positives (FPs) -- it can incorrectly identify an independent model trained with non-overlapping data from the same distribution as stolen. We further prove that DI also triggers FPs in realistic, non-linear suspect models.

- Data Leakage in Tabular Federated Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01785)
  - Mark Vero, Mislav Balunović, Dimitar I. Dimitrov, Martin Vechev.
  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Data Leakage Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Compared to the NLP and image domains, reconstruction of tabular data poses several unique challenges: (i) categorical features introduce a significantly more difficult mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, (ii) the mix of categorical and continuous features causes high variance in the final reconstructions, and (iii) structured data makes it difficult for the adversary to judge reconstruction quality. In this work, we tackle these challenges and propose the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular data, called TabLeak. TabLeak is based on three key ingredients: (i) a softmax structural prior, implicitly converting the mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem into an easier fully continuous one, (ii) a way to reduce the variance of our reconstructions through a pooled ensembling scheme exploiting the structure of tabular data, and (iii) an entropy measure which can successfully assess reconstruction quality.

  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Sum-Product Networks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Data protection regulations like the GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act give users more control over the data that is collected about them. Deleting the collected data is often insufficient to guarantee data privacy since it is often used to train machine learning models, which can expose information about the training data. Thus, a guarantee that a trained model does not expose information about its training data is additionally needed. In this paper, we present UnlearnSPN -- an algorithm that removes the influence of single data points from a trained sum-product network and thereby allows fulfilling data privacy requirements on demand.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> New methods designed to preserve data privacy require careful scrutiny. Failure to preserve privacy is hard to detect, and yet can lead to catastrophic results when a system implementing a ``privacy-preserving'' method is attacked. A recent work selected for an Outstanding Paper Award at ICML 2022 (Dong et al., 2022) claims that dataset condensation (DC) significantly improves data privacy when training machine learning models. This claim is supported by theoretical analysis of a specific dataset condensation technique and an empirical evaluation of resistance to some existing membership inference attacks.

Leveraging the infintesimal jacknife, we develop an online unlearning algorithm that is both computationally and memory efficient. Unlike prior memory efficient unlearning algorithms, we target models that minimize objectives with non-smooth regularizers, such as the commonly used ℓ1, elastic net, or nuclear norm penalties.

Our model architecture is a composition of three independent neural networks that, when collectively used, allow for learning a deformation field that is able to impede patient re-identification. The individual influence of each component is investigated with an ablation study. Quantitative results on the ChestX-ray14 dataset show a reduction of patient re-identification from 81.8% to 58.6% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with little impact on the abnormality classification performance.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and distance measurements.

  - Key Word: Renyi Differential Privacy; Propose-Test-Release.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Propose-Test-Release (PTR) is a differential privacy framework that works with local sensitivity of functions, instead of their global sensitivity. This framework is typically used for releasing robust statistics such as median or trimmed mean in a differentially private manner. While PTR is a common framework introduced over a decade ago, using it in applications such as robust SGD where we need many adaptive robust queries is challenging. This is mainly due to the lack of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) analysis, an essential ingredient underlying the moments accountant approach for differentially private deep learning. In this work, we generalize the standard PTR and derive the first RDP bound for it when the target function has bounded global sensitivity.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> we propose Multi-modal Models Membership Inference (M^4I) with two attack methods to infer the membership status, named metric-based (MB) M^4I and feature-based (FB) M^4I, respectively. More specifically, MB M^4I adopts similarity metrics while attacking to infer target data membership. FB M^4I uses a pre-trained shadow multi-modal feature extractor to achieve the purpose of data inference attack by comparing the similarities from extracted input and output features.

These evaluations may help FL practitioners select appropriate protection mechanisms given specific requirements.

  - Kew Word: Attribute Inference Attacks; Data Imputation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our main conclusions are: (1) previous attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model, but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3) white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be predicted without having access to the model.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We perform the first systematic study of group property inference attacks (GPIA) against GNNs. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat models under both black-box and white-box settings with various types of adversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on three representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks whose accuracy outperforms the baseline approaches.

  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Exact Unlearning; Approximate Unlearning; Data Removal; Data Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Removing the influence of a specified subset of training data from a machine learning model may be required to address issues such as privacy, fairness, and data quality. Retraining the model from scratch on the remaining data after removal of the subset is an effective but often infeasible option, due to its computational expense. The past few years have therefore seen several novel approaches towards efficient removal, forming the field of "machine unlearning", however, many aspects of the literature published thus far are disparate and lack consensus. In this paper, we summarise and compare seven state-of-the-art machine unlearning algorithms, consolidate definitions of core concepts used in the field, reconcile different approaches for evaluating algorithms, and discuss issues related to applying machine unlearning in practice.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a unified federated learning framework that reconciles horizontal and vertical federated learning. Based on this framework, we formulate and quantify the trade-offs between privacy leakage, utility loss, and efficiency reduction, which leads us to the No-Free-Lunch (NFL) theorem for the federated learning system. 

- Membership Inference Attacks by Exploiting Loss Trajectory. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14933)
  - Yiyong Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang. *CCS 2022*
  - Key Word: Membership Inference Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Existing attack methods have commonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the given target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member and non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are naturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new attack method, called \system, which can exploit the membership information from the whole training process of the target model for improving the attack performance.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We consider the setting of property inference attacks in which the attacker can poison a subset of the training dataset and query the trained target model. Motivated by our theoretical analysis of model confidences under poisoning, we design an efficient property inference attack, SNAP, which obtains higher attack success and requires lower amounts of poisoning than the state-of-the-art poisoning-based property inference attack by Mahloujifar et al.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of multi-exit networks through the lens of membership leakages. In particular, we first leverage the existing attack methodologies to quantify the multi-exit networks' vulnerability to membership leakages. Our experimental results show that multi-exit networks are less vulnerable to membership leakages and the exit (number and depth) attached to the backbone model is highly correlated with the attack performance.

To do so, we simulate out-of-focus images corresponding to a realistic conventional camera with fixed focal length, aperture, and focus, as well as grayscale images coming from a monochrome camera. We then prove, through an experimental study, that we can build a privacy-aware camera that cannot extract personal information such as license plate numbers.

In particular, JoPEQ utilizes vector quantization based on random lattice, a universal compression technique whose byproduct distortion is statistically equivalent to additive noise. This distortion is leveraged to enhance privacy by augmenting the model updates with dedicated multivariate privacy preserving noise.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose "Split-U-Net" and successfully apply SL for collaborative biomedical image segmentation. Nonetheless, SL requires the exchanging of intermediate activation maps and gradients to allow training models across different feature spaces, which might leak data and raise privacy concerns. Therefore, we also quantify the amount of data leakage in common SL scenarios for biomedical image segmentation and provide ways to counteract such leakage by applying appropriate defense strategies.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We fill this gap by presenting a large-scale measurement of different membership inference attacks and defenses. We systematize membership inference through the study of nine attacks and six defenses and measure the performance of different attacks and defenses in the holistic evaluation. We then quantify the impact of the threat model on the results of these attacks. We find that some assumptions of the threat model, such as same-architecture and same-distribution between shadow and target models, are unnecessary. We are also the first to execute attacks on the real-world data collected from the Internet, instead of laboratory datasets.

These potential solutions can help achieve a much strong TEE-enabled ML for privacy guarantees without introducing computation and system costs.

  - Key Word: Membership Inference Attacks; Data Augmentation; Adversarial Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose to investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem, we deploy a recent attack that can capture the memorization degrees of individual samples for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil non-trivial findings about the connections between three important properties of machine learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial robustness.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In regression problems with no privacy constraints on the source or target data, a discrepancy minimization algorithm based on several theoretical guarantees was shown to outperform a number of other adaptation algorithm baselines. Building on that approach, we design differentially private discrepancy-based algorithms for adaptation from a source domain with public labeled data to a target domain with unlabeled private data. The design and analysis of our private algorithms critically hinge upon several key properties we prove for a smooth approximation of the weighted discrepancy, such as its smoothness with respect to the ℓ1-norm and the sensitivity of its gradient.

- Dropout is NOT All You Need to Prevent Gradient Leakage. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06163)
  - Daniel Scheliga, Patrick Mäder, Marco Seeland.
  - Key Word: Dropout; Gradient Inversion Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent observations suggest that dropout could mitigate gradient leakage and improve model utility if added to neural networks. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been systematically researched yet. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the effect of dropout on iterative gradient inversion attacks. We find that state of the art attacks are not able to reconstruct the client data due to the stochasticity induced by dropout during model training. Nonetheless, we argue that dropout does not offer reliable protection if the dropout induced stochasticity is adequately modeled during attack optimization. Consequently, we propose a novel Dropout Inversion Attack (DIA) that jointly optimizes for client data and dropout masks to approximate the stochastic client model.

  - Key Word: Proof-of-Learning; Adversarial Examples.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Proof-of-learning (PoL) proposes a model owner use machine learning training checkpoints to establish a proof of having expended the necessary compute for training. The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security guarantees for scalability to deep learning by being applicable to stochastic gradient descent and adaptive variants. This lack of formal analysis leaves the possibility that an attacker may be able to spoof a proof for a model they did not train. We contribute a formal analysis of why the PoL protocol cannot be formally (dis)proven to be robust against spoofing adversaries. To do so, we disentangle the two roles of proof verification in PoL: (a) efficiently determining if a proof is a valid gradient descent trajectory, and (b) establishing precedence by making it more expensive to craft a proof after training completes (i.e., spoofing).

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We take a different angle by studying the training data privacy of SSL. Specifically, we propose the first data augmentation-based membership inference attacks against ML models trained by SSL. Given a data sample and the black-box access to a model, the goal of membership inference attack is to determine whether the data sample belongs to the training dataset of the model. Our evaluation shows that the proposed attack can consistently outperform existing membership inference attacks and achieves the best performance against the model trained by SSL.

- Learnable Privacy-Preserving Anonymization for Pedestrian Images. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11677) [[code]](https://github.com/whuzjw/privacy-reid)
  - Junwu Zhang, Mang Ye, Yao Yang. *MM 2022*
  - Key Word: Privacy Protection; Person Re-Identification.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper studies a novel privacy-preserving anonymization problem for pedestrian images, which preserves personal identity information (PII) for authorized models and prevents PII from being recognized by third parties. Conventional anonymization methods unavoidably cause semantic information loss, leading to limited data utility. Besides, existing learned anonymization techniques, while retaining various identity-irrelevant utilities, will change the pedestrian identity, and thus are unsuitable for training robust re-identification models. To explore the privacy-utility trade-off for pedestrian images, we propose a joint learning reversible anonymization framework, which can reversibly generate full-body anonymous images with little performance drop on person re-identification tasks.

  - Key Word: Watermarking Neural Networks; Certified Defenses; Randomized Smoothing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Watermarking is a commonly used strategy to protect creators' rights to digital images, videos and audio. Recently, watermarking methods have been extended to deep learning models -- in principle, the watermark should be preserved when an adversary tries to copy the model. However, in practice, watermarks can often be removed by an intelligent adversary. Several papers have proposed watermarking methods that claim to be empirically resistant to different types of removal attacks, but these new techniques often fail in the face of new or better-tuned adversaries. In this paper, we propose a certifiable watermarking method. Using the randomized smoothing technique proposed in Chiang et al., we show that our watermark is guaranteed to be unremovable unless the model parameters are changed by more than a certain l2 threshold.

  - Paul Mangold, Aurélien Bellet, Joseph Salmon, Marc Tommasi.
  - Key Word: Differentially Private Empirical Risk Minimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we study differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM). It has been shown that the (worst-case) utility of DP-ERM reduces as the dimension increases. This is a major obstacle to privately learning large machine learning models. In high dimension, it is common for some model's parameters to carry more information than others. To exploit this, we propose a differentially private greedy coordinate descent (DP-GCD) algorithm. At each iteration, DP-GCD privately performs a coordinate-wise gradient step along the gradients' (approximately) greatest entry.

  - Key Word: Differentially Private Learning; Large Language Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Large pretrained models can be privately fine-tuned to achieve performance approaching that of non-private models. A common theme in these results is the surprising observation that high-dimensional models can achieve favorable privacy-utility trade-offs. This seemingly contradicts known results on the model-size dependence of differentially private convex learning and raises the following research question: When does the performance of differentially private learning not degrade with increasing model size? We identify that the magnitudes of gradients projected onto subspaces is a key factor that determines performance. To precisely characterize this for private convex learning, we introduce a condition on the objective that we term restricted Lipschitz continuity and derive improved bounds for the excess empirical and population risks that are dimension-independent under additional conditions.

  - Key Word: Membership Inference Attacks; Reconstruction Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We connect these phenomena. We propose a technique to measure to what extent models ``forget'' the specifics of training examples, becoming less susceptible to privacy attacks on examples they have not seen recently. We show that, while non-convexity can prevent forgetting from happening in the worst-case, standard image and speech models empirically do forget examples over time. We identify nondeterminism as a potential explanation, showing that deterministically trained models do not forget. Our results suggest that examples seen early when training with extremely large datasets -- for instance those examples used to pre-train a model -- may observe privacy benefits at the expense of examples seen later.

  - Key Word: Privacy; Patient-wise Forgetting; Scrubbing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the influence of patient data on model performance and formulate two hypotheses for a patient's data: either they are common and similar to other patients or form edge cases, i.e. unique and rare cases. We show that it is not possible to easily forget patient data. We propose a targeted forgetting approach to perform patient-wise forgetting. Extensive experiments on the benchmark Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset showcase the improved performance of the proposed targeted forgetting approach as opposed to a state-of-the-art method.

Unsupervised learning, in contrast, remains largely an open problem when it comes to (approximate or exact) efficient data deletion. In this paper, we propose a density-ratio-based framework for generative models. Using this framework, we introduce a fast method for approximate data deletion and a statistical test for estimating whether or not training points have been deleted. 

- Data Leakage in Federated Averaging. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12395)
  - Dimitar I. Dimitrov, Mislav Balunović, Nikola Konstantinov, Martin Vechev.
  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Gradient Inversion Attacks and Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent attacks have shown that user data can be reconstructed from FedSGD updates, thus breaking privacy. However, these attacks are of limited practical relevance as federated learning typically uses the FedAvg algorithm. It is generally accepted that reconstructing data from FedAvg updates is much harder than FedSGD as: (i) there are unobserved intermediate weight updates, (ii) the order of inputs matters, and (iii) the order of labels changes every epoch. In this work, we propose a new optimization-based attack which successfully attacks FedAvg by addressing the above challenges. First, we solve the optimization problem using automatic differentiation that forces a simulation of the client's update for the reconstructed labels and inputs so as to match the received client update. Second, we address the unknown input order by treating images at different epochs as independent during optimization, while relating them with a permutation invariant prior. Third, we reconstruct the labels by estimating the parameters of existing FedSGD attacks at every FedAvg step.

  - Key Word: Model Extraction Attack and Defense.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> To study the fundamental tradeoffs between model utility from a benign user's view and privacy from an adversary's view, we develop new metrics to quantify such tradeoffs, analyze their theoretical properties, and develop an optimization problem to understand the optimal adversarial attack and defense strategies. The developed concepts and theory match the empirical findings on the `equilibrium' between privacy and utility. In terms of optimization, the key ingredient that enables our results is a unified representation of the attack-defense problem as a min-max bi-level problem.

- The Privacy Onion Effect: Memorization is Relative. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10469)
  - Nicholas Carlini, Matthew Jagielski, Nicolas Papernot, Andreas Terzis, Florian Tramer, Chiyuan Zhang.
  - Key Word: Memorization; Differential Privacy; Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses; Machine Unlearning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Machine learning models trained on private datasets have been shown to leak their private data. While recent work has found that the average data point is rarely leaked, the outlier samples are frequently subject to memorization and, consequently, privacy leakage. We demonstrate and analyse an Onion Effect of memorization: removing the "layer" of outlier points that are most vulnerable to a privacy attack exposes a new layer of previously-safe points to the same attack. We perform several experiments to study this effect, and understand why it occurs. The existence of this effect has various consequences. For example, it suggests that proposals to defend against memorization without training with rigorous privacy guarantees are unlikely to be effective. Further, it suggests that privacy-enhancing technologies such as machine unlearning could actually harm the privacy of other users.

  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Certified Data Removal; Graph Neural Networks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in practice and often processed using graph neural networks (GNNs). With the adoption of recent laws ensuring the ``right to be forgotten'', the problem of graph data removal has become of significant importance. To address the problem, we introduce the first known framework for \emph{certified graph unlearning} of GNNs. In contrast to standard machine unlearning, new analytical and heuristic unlearning challenges arise when dealing with complex graph data. First, three different types of unlearning requests need to be considered, including node feature, edge and node unlearning. Second, to establish provable performance guarantees, one needs to address challenges associated with feature mixing during propagation. The underlying analysis is illustrated on the example of simple graph convolutions (SGC) and their generalized PageRank (GPR) extensions, thereby laying the theoretical foundation for certified unlearning of GNNs.

Under this framework, for the key step of aggregating local embeddings trained at the clients in a private manner, we develop a secure embedding aggregation protocol named SecEA, which provides information-theoretical privacy guarantees for the set of entities and the corresponding embeddings at each client simultaneously, against a curious server and up to T < N/2 colluding clients.

  - Key Word: Model Extraction Attacks; Survey.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adversaries can create a copy of the model with (almost) identical behavior using the the prediction labels only. While many variants of this attack have been described, only scattered defence strategies have been proposed, addressing isolated threats. This raises the necessity for a thorough systematisation of the field of model stealing, to arrive at a comprehensive understanding why these attacks are successful, and how they could be holistically defended against. We address this by categorising and comparing model stealing attacks, assessing their performance, and exploring corresponding defence techniques in different settings.

  - Key Word: Reconstruction Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a novel reconstruction scheme that stems from recent theoretical results about the implicit bias in training neural networks with gradient-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show that reconstructing a large portion of the actual training samples from a trained neural network classifier is generally possible. This has negative implications on privacy, as it can be used as an attack for revealing sensitive training data. We demonstrate our method for binary MLP classifiers on a few standard computer vision datasets.

  - Key Word: Self-Supervised Pretraining; Differential Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We demonstrate self-supervised pretraining (SSP) is a scalable solution to deep learning with differential privacy (DP) regardless of the size of available public datasets in image classification. When facing the lack of public datasets, we show the features generated by SSP on only one single image enable a private classifier to obtain much better utility than the non-learned handcrafted features under the same privacy budget. When a moderate or large size public dataset is available, the features produced by SSP greatly outperform the features trained with labels on various complex private datasets under the same private budget.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The accelerated use of digital cameras prompts an increasing concern about privacy and security, particularly in applications such as action recognition. In this paper, we propose an optimizing framework to provide robust visual privacy protection along the human action recognition pipeline. Our framework parameterizes the camera lens to successfully degrade the quality of the videos to inhibit privacy attributes and protect against adversarial attacks while maintaining relevant features for activity recognition. We validate our approach with extensive simulations and hardware experiments.

  - Key Word: Data Stealing Attacks; Medical Imaging; Heathcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce the concept of data stealing attack during the export of neural networks. It consists in hiding some information in the exported network that allows the reconstruction outside the data lake of images initially stored in that data lake. More precisely, we show that it is possible to train a network that can perform lossy image compression and at the same time solve some utility tasks such as image segmentation.

  - Key Word: Generative Adversarial Nets; Differential Privacy; Membership Inference Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The privacy implications of generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a topic of great interest, leading to several recent algorithms for training GANs with privacy guarantees. By drawing connections to the generalization properties of GANs, we prove that under some assumptions, GAN-generated samples inherently satisfy some (weak) privacy guarantees. First, we show that if a GAN is trained on m samples and used to generate n samples, the generated samples are (epsilon, delta)-differentially-private for (epsilon, delta) pairs where delta scales as O(n/m). We show that under some special conditions, this upper bound is tight. Next, we study the robustness of GAN-generated samples to membership inference attacks. We model membership inference as a hypothesis test in which the adversary must determine whether a given sample was drawn from the training dataset or from the underlying data distribution.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a new defense method to protect the privacy of clients' data by learning to obscure data. Our defense method can generate synthetic samples that are totally distinct from the original samples, but they can also maximally preserve their predictive features and guarantee the model performance. Furthermore, our defense strategy makes the gradient leakage attack and its variants extremely difficult to reconstruct the client data.

  - Key Word: Dataset Condensation; Continual Learning; Membership Inference Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> we address these challenges using neural Feature Regression with Pooling (FRePo), achieving the state-of-the-art performance with an order of magnitude less memory requirement and two orders of magnitude faster training than previous methods. The proposed algorithm is analogous to truncated backpropagation through time with a pool of models to alleviate various types of overfitting in dataset distillation. FRePo significantly outperforms the previous methods on CIFAR100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K. Furthermore, we show that high-quality distilled data can greatly improve various downstream applications, such as continual learning and membership inference defense.

  - Key Word: Fairness; Verification.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the problem of verifying, training, and guaranteeing individual fairness of neural network models. A popular approach for enforcing fairness is to translate a fairness notion into constraints over the parameters of the model. However, such a translation does not always guarantee fair predictions of the trained neural network model. To address this challenge, we develop a counterexample-guided post-processing technique to provably enforce fairness constraints at prediction time.

- Privacy for Free: How does Dataset Condensation Help Privacy? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00240)

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We for the first time identify that dataset condensation (DC) which is originally designed for improving training efficiency is also a better solution to replace the traditional data generators for private data generation, thus providing privacy for free. To demonstrate the privacy benefit of DC, we build a connection between DC and differential privacy, and theoretically prove on linear feature extractors (and then extended to non-linear feature extractors) that the existence of one sample has limited impact (O(m/n)) on the parameter distribution of networks trained on m samples synthesized from n(n≫m) raw samples by DC.

  - Key Word: Benign Overparameterization; Membership Inference Attacks; Early Stopping.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Does a neural network's privacy have to be at odds with its accuracy? In this work, we study the effects the number of training epochs and parameters have on a neural network's vulnerability to membership inference (MI) attacks, which aim to extract potentially private information about the training data. We first demonstrate how the number of training epochs and parameters individually induce a privacy-utility trade-off: more of either improves generalization performance at the expense of lower privacy. However, remarkably, we also show that jointly tuning both can eliminate this privacy-utility trade-off.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a novel framework FaceMAE, where the face privacy and recognition performance are considered simultaneously. Firstly, randomly masked face images are used to train the reconstruction module in FaceMAE. We tailor the instance relation matching (IRM) module to minimize the distribution gap between real faces and FaceMAE reconstructed ones. During the deployment phase, we use trained FaceMAE to reconstruct images from masked faces of unseen identities without extra training.

- Unlocking High-Accuracy Differentially Private Image Classification through Scale. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13650) [[code]](https://github.com/deepmind/jax_privacy)
  - Soham De, Leonard Berrada, Jamie Hayes, Samuel L. Smith, Borja Balle.
  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Image Classication.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Differential Privacy (DP) provides a formal privacy guarantee preventing adversaries with access to a machine learning model from extracting information about individual training points. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), the most popular DP training method for deep learning, realizes this protection by injecting noise during training. However previous works have found that DP-SGD often leads to a significant degradation in performance on standard image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, some authors have postulated that DP-SGD inherently performs poorly on large models, since the norm of the noise required to preserve privacy is proportional to the model dimension. In contrast, we demonstrate that DP-SGD on over-parameterized models can perform significantly better than previously thought. Combining careful hyper-parameter tuning with simple techniques to ensure signal propagation and improve the convergence rate, we obtain a new SOTA without extra data on CIFAR-10 of 81.4% under (8, 10^{-5})-DP using a 40-layer Wide-ResNet, improving over the previous SOTA of 71.7%.

Our training framework consists of three main components: anonymization function, self-supervised privacy removal branch, and action recognition branch. We train our framework using a minimax optimization strategy to minimize the action recognition cost function and maximize the privacy cost function through a contrastive self-supervised loss.

This explains the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training. Based on the observation, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss.

- Quantifying Memorization Across Neural Language Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07646)
  - Nicholas Carlini, Daphne Ippolito, Matthew Jagielski, Katherine Lee, Florian Tramer, Chiyuan Zhang.
  - Key Word: Reconstruction Attacks; Membership Inference Attacks; Language Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes complicated when generalizing these results across model families. On the whole, we find that memorization in LMs is more prevalent than previously believed and will likely get worse as models continues to scale, at least without active mitigations.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We discuss the mismatch between the narrow assumptions made by popular data protection techniques (data sanitization and differential privacy), and the broadness of natural language and of privacy as a social norm. We argue that existing protection methods cannot guarantee a generic and meaningful notion of privacy for language models. We conclude that language models should be trained on text data which was explicitly produced for public use.

We show that two distinct privacy accounting methods -- Renyi differential privacy and Fisher information leakage -- both offer strong semantic protection against data reconstruction attacks.

This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug & Play Attacks, which relax the dependency between the target model and image prior, and enable the use of a single GAN to attack a wide range of targets, requiring only minor adjustments to the attack.

  - Key Word: Reconstruction Attacks; Differential Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work studies this question from the lens of a powerful informed adversary who knows all the training data points except one. By instantiating concrete attacks, we show it is feasible to reconstruct the remaining data point in this stringent threat model. For convex models (e.g. logistic regression), reconstruction attacks are simple and can be derived in closed-form. For more general models (e.g. neural networks), we propose an attack strategy based on training a reconstructor network that receives as input the weights of the model under attack and produces as output the target data point.

We find that applying augmentation to increase the model’s utility does not mitigate the risk and protection comes with a utility penalty.

  - Chiyuan Zhang, Daphne Ippolito, Katherine Lee, Matthew Jagielski, Florian Tramèr, Nicholas Carlini.
  - Key Word: Counterfactual Memorization; Label Memorization; Influence Function.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> An open question in previous studies of memorization in language models is how to filter out "common" memorization. In fact, most memorization criteria strongly correlate with the number of occurrences in the training set, capturing "common" memorization such as familiar phrases, public knowledge or templated texts. In this paper, we provide a principled perspective inspired by a taxonomy of human memory in Psychology. From this perspective, we formulate a notion of counterfactual memorization, which characterizes how a model's predictions change if a particular document is omitted during training. We identify and study counterfactually-memorized training examples in standard text datasets. We further estimate the influence of each training example on the validation set and on generated texts, and show that this can provide direct evidence of the source of memorization at test time.

  - Nicholas Carlini, Steve Chien, Milad Nasr, Shuang Song, Andreas Terzis, Florian Tramer.
  - Key Word: Membership Inference Attacks; Theory of Memorization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A membership inference attack allows an adversary to query a trained machine learning model to predict whether or not a particular example was contained in the model's training dataset. These attacks are currently evaluated using average-case "accuracy" metrics that fail to characterize whether the attack can confidently identify any members of the training set. We argue that attacks should instead be evaluated by computing their true-positive rate at low (e.g., less than 0.1%) false-positive rates, and find most prior attacks perform poorly when evaluated in this way. To address this we develop a Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) that carefully combines multiple ideas from the literature. Our attack is 10x more powerful at low false-positive rates, and also strictly dominates prior attacks on existing metrics.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Membership inference attacks (MIA) try to detect if data samples were used to train a neural network model, e.g. to detect copyright abuses. We show that models with higher dimensional input and output are more vulnerable to MIA, and address in more detail models for image translation and semantic segmentation, including medical image segmentation. We show that reconstruction-errors can lead to very effective MIA attacks as they are indicative of memorization. Unfortunately, reconstruction error alone is less effective at discriminating between non-predictable images used in training and easy to predict images that were never seen before. To overcome this, we propose using a novel predictability error that can be computed for each sample, and its computation does not require a training set.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce Confidential and Private Collaborative (CaPC) learning, the first method provably achieving both confidentiality and privacy in a collaborative setting. We leverage secure multi-party computation (MPC), homomorphic encryption (HE), and other techniques in combination with privately aggregated teacher models. We demonstrate how CaPC allows participants to collaborate without having to explicitly join their training sets or train a central model.

- Illuminating the dark spaces of healthcare with ambient intelligence. [[paper]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2669-y)
  - Albert Haque, Arnold Milstein, Li Fei-Fei. *Nature*
  - Key Word: Healthcare; Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Advances in machine learning and contactless sensors have given rise to ambient intelligence—physical spaces that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of humans. Here we review how this technology could improve our understanding of the metaphorically dark, unobserved spaces of healthcare. In hospital spaces, early applications could soon enable more efficient clinical workflows and improved patient safety in intensive care units and operating rooms. In daily living spaces, ambient intelligence could prolong the independence of older individuals and improve the management of individuals with a chronic disease by understanding everyday behaviour. Similar to other technologies, transformation into clinical applications at scale must overcome challenges such as rigorous clinical validation, appropriate data privacy and model transparency.

  - Key Word: Watermarking.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Neural networks have been shown effective in deep steganography for hiding a full image in another. However, the reason for its success remains not fully clear. Under the existing cover (C) dependent deep hiding (DDH) pipeline, it is challenging to analyze how the secret (S) image is encoded since the encoded message cannot be analyzed independently. We propose a novel universal deep hiding (UDH) meta-architecture to disentangle the encoding of S from C. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that the success of deep steganography can be attributed to a frequency discrepancy between C and the encoded secret image.

We introduce the novel concept of ϵ-approximation of datasets, obtaining datasets which are much smaller than or are significant corruptions of the original training data while maintaining similar model performance. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm called Kernel Inducing Points (KIP) for obtaining such remarkable datasets, inspired by the recent developments in the correspondence between infinitely-wide neural networks and kernel ridge-regression (KRR).

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Learning on anonymized data typically results in significant degradation in accuracy. In this work, we propose a method that is able to achieve better model accuracy by using the knowledge encoded within the trained model, and guiding our anonymization process to minimize the impact on the model's accuracy, a process we call accuracy-guided anonymization. We demonstrate that by focusing on the model's accuracy rather than generic information loss measures, our method outperforms state of the art k-anonymity methods in terms of the achieved utility, in particular with high values of k and large numbers of quasi-identifiers.

The proposed forgetting procedure has a deterministic part derived from the differential equations of a linearized version of the model, and a stochastic part that ensures information destruction by adding noise tailored to the geometry of the loss landscape. We exploit the connections between the activation and weight dynamics of a DNN inspired by Neural Tangent Kernels to compute the information in the activations.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving high model performance, while offering the desired level of privacy.

We investigate algorithmic principles that enable efficient data deletion in ML. For the specific setting of k-means clustering, we propose two provably efficient deletion algorithms which achieve an average of over 100X improvement in deletion efficiency across 6 datasets, while producing clusters of comparable statistical quality to a canonical k-means++ baseline.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper presents a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for large language models (LLMs). It addresses the issue of LLMs learning and perpetuating harmful social biases. The paper begins by formalizing social bias and fairness in natural language processing and introduces desiderata for fairness in LLMs. It then provides three taxonomies: one for bias evaluation metrics, another for bias evaluation datasets, and a third for bias mitigation techniques. These taxonomies help categorize and organize research in this area. The paper aims to guide researchers and practitioners in understanding and addressing bias propagation in LLMs and also highlights open problems and challenges for future work.

  - Key Word: Fine-Tuning Datasets; Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We investigate bias when conceptualized as both spurious correlations between the target task and a sensitive attribute as well as underrepresentation of a particular group in the dataset. Under both notions of bias, we find that (1) models finetuned on top of pretrained models can indeed inherit their biases, but (2) this bias can be corrected for through relatively minor interventions to the finetuning dataset, and often with a negligible impact to performance. Our findings imply that careful curation of the finetuning dataset is important for reducing biases on a downstream task, and doing so can even compensate for bias in the pretrained model.

We instead re-cast fair machine learning as an imitation learning task by introducing superhuman fairness, which seeks to simultaneously outperform human decisions on multiple predictive performance and fairness measures.

We first develop theoretical bounds on the unfairness and expected loss at deployment, and then derive sufficient conditions under which fairness and accuracy can be perfectly transferred via invariant representation learning. Guided by this, we design a learning algorithm such that fair ML models learned with training data still have high fairness and accuracy when deployment environments change.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We proposed Fairify, the first SMT-based approach to verify individual fairness property in neural network (NN) models. Individual fairness ensures that any two similar individuals get similar treatment irrespective of their protected attributes e.g., race, sex, age. Verifying this fairness property is hard because of its global nature and the presence of non-linear computation nodes in NN. We proposed sound approach to make individual fairness verification tractable for the developers. The key idea is that many neurons in the NN always remain inactive when a smaller part of the input domain is considered.

  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Federated learning provides an effective paradigm to jointly optimize a model benefited from rich distributed data while protecting data privacy. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity nature of distributed data makes it challenging to define and ensure fairness among local agents. Currently popular egalitarian and weighted equity-based fairness measures suffer from the aforementioned pitfall. In this work, we aim to formally represent this problem and address these fairness issues using concepts from co-operative game theory and social choice theory.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent work has shown that prior methods achieve worse accuracy-fairness tradeoffs than originally suggested by their results. This dictates the need for FRL methods that provide provable upper bounds on unfairness of any downstream classifier, a challenge yet unsolved. In this work we address this challenge and propose Fairness with Restricted Encoders (FARE), the first FRL method with provable fairness guarantees. Our key insight is that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables us to derive suitable fairness guarantees, while allowing empirical accuracy-fairness tradeoffs comparable to prior work.

The key idea of RAAN is to mitigate the differences of biased representations between different sensitive attribute groups by assigning each sample an adversarial robust weight, which is defined on the representations of adversarial attribute neighbors, i.e, the samples from different protected groups.

Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing on anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an image) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the protected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections between a common fairness criterion - separation - and a common notion of robustness - risk invariance. 

- It's Not Fairness, and It's Not Fair: The Failure of Distributional Equality and the Promise of Relational Equality in Complete-Information Hiring Games. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05602)
  - Benjamin Fish, Luke Stark.
  - Key Word: Group Fairness; Individual Fairness; Causal Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Existing efforts to formulate computational definitions of fairness have largely focused on distributional notions of equality, where equality is defined by the resources or decisions given to individuals in the system. Yet existing discrimination and injustice is often the result of unequal social relations, rather than an unequal distribution of resources. Here, we show how optimizing for existing computational and economic definitions of fairness and equality fail to prevent unequal social relations. To do this, we provide an example of a self-confirming equilibrium in a simple hiring market that is relationally unequal but satisfies existing distributional notions of fairness.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose to address this issue by introducing the problem of learning fair representations in an incremental learning setting. To this end, we present Fairness-aware Incremental Representation Learning (FaIRL), a representation learning system that can sustain fairness while incrementally learning new tasks. FaIRL is able to achieve fairness and learn new tasks by controlling the rate-distortion function of the learned representations.

  - Key Word: ImageNet Bias.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We analyze the 13,450 images from 269 classes that represent wild animals in the ImageNet-1k validation set, with the participation of expert ecologists. We find that many of the classes are ill-defined or overlapping, and that 12% of the images are incorrectly labeled, with some classes having >90% of images incorrect. We also find that both the wildlife-related labels and images included in ImageNet-1k present significant geographical and cultural biases, as well as ambiguities such as artificial animals, multiple species in the same image, or the presence of humans.

- Discover and Mitigate Unknown Biases with Debiasing Alternate Networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10077) [[code]](https://github.com/zhihengli-UR/DebiAN)
  - Zhiheng Li, Anthony Hoogs, Chenliang Xu. *ECCV 2022*
  - Key Word: Bias Identification; Bias Mitigation; Fairness; Unsupervised Debiasing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Deep image classifiers have been found to learn biases from datasets. To mitigate the biases, most previous methods require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, skin tone) as full-supervision, which has two limitations: 1) it is infeasible when the labels are unavailable; 2) they are incapable of mitigating unknown biases -- biases that humans do not preconceive. To resolve those problems, we propose Debiasing Alternate Networks (DebiAN), which comprises two networks -- a Discoverer and a Classifier. By training in an alternate manner, the discoverer tries to find multiple unknown biases of the classifier without any annotations of biases, and the classifier aims at unlearning the biases identified by the discoverer.

- Mitigating Algorithmic Bias with Limited Annotations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10018) [[code]](https://github.com/guanchuwang/apod-fairness)
  - Guanchu Wang, Mengnan Du, Ninghao Liu, Na Zou, Xia Hu.
  - Key Word: Fairness; Active Bias Mitigation; Limited Annotations.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> When sensitive attributes are not disclosed or available, it is needed to manually annotate a small part of the training data to mitigate bias. However, the skewed distribution across different sensitive groups preserves the skewness of the original dataset in the annotated subset, which leads to non-optimal bias mitigation. To tackle this challenge, we propose Active Penalization Of Discrimination (APOD), an interactive framework to guide the limited annotations towards maximally eliminating the effect of algorithmic bias. The proposed APOD integrates discrimination penalization with active instance selection to efficiently utilize the limited annotation budget, and it is theoretically proved to be capable of bounding the algorithmic bias.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper provides a comprehensive survey of bias mitigation methods for achieving fairness in Machine Learning (ML) models. We collect a total of 234 publications concerning bias mitigation for ML classifiers. These methods can be distinguished based on their intervention procedure (i.e., pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and the technology they apply. We investigate how existing bias mitigation methods are evaluated in the literature. In particular, we consider datasets, metrics and benchmarking. Based on the gathered insights (e.g., what is the most popular fairness metric? How many datasets are used for evaluating bias mitigation methods?).

- Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14397)
  - Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu.
  - Key Word: Fairness; Healthcare; Survey.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Benefiting from the digitization of healthcare data and the development of computing power, machine learning methods are increasingly used in the healthcare domain. Fairness problems have been identified in machine learning for healthcare, resulting in an unfair allocation of limited healthcare resources or excessive health risks for certain groups. Therefore, addressing the fairness problems has recently attracted increasing attention from the healthcare community. However, the intersection of machine learning for healthcare and fairness in machine learning remains understudied. In this review, we build the bridge by exposing fairness problems, summarizing possible biases, sorting out mitigation methods and pointing out challenges along with opportunities for the future.

- Transferring Fairness under Distribution Shifts via Fair Consistency Regularization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12796)
  - Bang An, Zora Che, Mucong Ding, Furong Huang.
  - Key Word: Fairness; Distribution Shifts; Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study how to transfer model fairness under distribution shifts, a widespread issue in practice. We conduct a fine-grained analysis of how the fair model is affected under different types of distribution shifts and find that domain shifts are more challenging than subpopulation shifts. Inspired by the success of self-training in transferring accuracy under domain shifts, we derive a sufficient condition for transferring group fairness. Guided by it, we propose a practical algorithm with a fair consistency regularization as the key component.

- Input-agnostic Certified Group Fairness via Gaussian Parameter Smoothing. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11423)
  - Jiayin Jin, Zeru Zhang, Yang Zhou, Lingfei Wu.
  - Key Word: Fair Classification; Group Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Only recently, researchers attempt to provide classification algorithms with provable group fairness guarantees. Most of these algorithms suffer from harassment caused by the requirement that the training and deployment data follow the same distribution. This paper proposes an input-agnostic certified group fairness algorithm, FairSmooth, for improving the fairness of classification models while maintaining the remarkable prediction accuracy. A Gaussian parameter smoothing method is developed to transform base classifiers into their smooth versions. An optimal individual smooth classifier is learnt for each group with only the data regarding the group and an overall smooth classifier for all groups is generated by averaging the parameters of all the individual smooth ones.

FairGrad is easy to implement and can accommodate various standard fairness definitions. Furthermore, we show that it is comparable to standard baselines over various datasets including ones used in natural language processing and computer vision.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The fast spreading adoption of machine learning (ML) by companies across industries poses significant regulatory challenges. One such challenge is scalability: how can regulatory bodies efficiently audit these ML models, ensuring that they are fair? In this paper, we initiate the study of query-based auditing algorithms that can estimate the demographic parity of ML models in a query-efficient manner. We propose an optimal deterministic algorithm, as well as a practical randomized, oracle-efficient algorithm with comparable guarantees.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Algorithmic fairness has attracted increasing attention in the machine learning community. Various definitions are proposed in the literature, but the differences and connections among them are not clearly addressed. In this paper, we review and reflect on various fairness notions previously proposed in machine learning literature, and make an attempt to draw connections to arguments in moral and political philosophy, especially theories of justice. We also consider fairness inquiries from a dynamic perspective, and further consider the long-term impact that is induced by current prediction and decision.

  - Key Word: Fairness; Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> As machine learning algorithms are deployed on sensitive data in critical decision making processes, it is becoming increasingly important that they are also private and fair. In this paper, we show that, when the data has a long-tailed structure, it is not possible to build accurate learning algorithms that are both private and results in higher accuracy on minority subpopulations. We further show that relaxing overall accuracy can lead to good fairness even with strict privacy requirements.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The goal of this paper is to standardize the inconsistent experimental settings and propose a consistent model parameter selection criterion for debiasing. Based on such unified experimental settings and model parameter selection criterion, we build a benchmark named DebiasBench which includes five datasets and seven debiasing methods. We carefully conduct extensive experiments in various aspects and show that different state-of-the-art methods work best in different datasets, respectively. Even, the vanilla method, the method with no debiasing module, also shows competitive results in datasets with low bias severity.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the transferability of statistical group fairness for machine learning predictors (i.e., classifiers or regressors) subject to bounded distribution shift, a phenomenon frequently caused by user adaptation to a deployed model or a dynamic environment. Herein, we develop a bound characterizing such transferability, flagging potentially inappropriate deployments of machine learning for socially consequential tasks.

  - Key Word: Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a solvable high-dimensional model of data imbalance, where parametric control over the many bias-inducing factors allows for an extensive exploration of the bias inheritance mechanism. Through the tools of statistical physics, we analytically characterise the typical behaviour of learning models trained in our synthetic framework and find similar unfairness behaviours as those observed on more realistic data. However, we also identify a positive transfer effect between the different subpopulations within the data. This suggests that mixing data with different statistical properties could be helpful, provided the learning model is made aware of this structure.

  - Key Word: Debiasing; Benchmark; Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a debiasing algorithm, called PGD (Per-sample Gradient-based Debiasing), that comprises three steps: (1) training a model on uniform batch sampling, (2) setting the importance of each sample in proportion to the norm of the sample gradient, and (3) training the model using importance-batch sampling, whose probability is obtained in step (2). Compared with existing baselines for various synthetic and real-world datasets, the proposed method showed state-of-the-art accuracy for a the classification task. Furthermore, we describe theoretical understandings about how PGD can mitigate dataset bias.

- Certifying Some Distributional Fairness with Subpopulation Decomposition. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15494)
  - Mintong Kang, Linyi Li, Maurice Weber, Yang Liu, Ce Zhang, Bo Li.
  - Key Word: Certified Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first formulate the certified fairness of an ML model trained on a given data distribution as an optimization problem based on the model performance loss bound on a fairness constrained distribution, which is within bounded distributional distance with the training distribution. We then propose a general fairness certification framework and instantiate it for both sensitive shifting and general shifting scenarios. In particular, we propose to solve the optimization problem by decomposing the original data distribution into analytical subpopulations and proving the convexity of the subproblems to solve them. We evaluate our certified fairness on six real-world datasets and show that our certification is tight in the sensitive shifting scenario and provides non-trivial certification under general shifting.

- Fairness via Explanation Quality: Evaluating Disparities in the Quality of Post hoc Explanations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07277)
  - Jessica Dai, Sohini Upadhyay, Ulrich Aivodji, Stephen H. Bach, Himabindu Lakkaraju. *AIES 2022*
  - Key Word: Fairness; Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first outline the key properties which constitute explanation quality and where disparities can be particularly problematic. We then leverage these properties to propose a novel evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the quality of explanations output by state-of-the-art methods. Using this framework, we carry out a rigorous empirical analysis to understand if and when group-based disparities in explanation quality arise. Our results indicate that such disparities are more likely to occur when the models being explained are complex and highly non-linear. In addition, we also observe that certain post hoc explanation methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are more likely to exhibit the aforementioned disparities.

  - Shaden Alshammari, Yu-Xiong Wang, Deva Ramanan, Shu Kong. *CVPR 2022*
  - Key Word: Long-tailed Recognition; Weight Balancing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The key to addressing LTR is to balance various aspects including data distribution, training losses, and gradients in learning. We explore an orthogonal direction, weight balancing, motivated by the empirical observation that the naively trained classifier has "artificially" larger weights in norm for common classes (because there exists abundant data to train them, unlike the rare classes). We investigate three techniques to balance weights, L2-normalization, weight decay, and MaxNorm. We first point out that L2-normalization "perfectly" balances per-class weights to be unit norm, but such a hard constraint might prevent classes from learning better classifiers. In contrast, weight decay penalizes larger weights more heavily and so learns small balanced weights; the MaxNorm constraint encourages growing small weights within a norm ball but caps all the weights by the radius. Our extensive study shows that both help learn balanced weights and greatly improve the LTR accuracy. Surprisingly, weight decay, although underexplored in LTR, significantly improves over prior work. Therefore, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm and propose a simple approach to LTR: (1) learning features using the cross-entropy loss by tuning weight decay, and (2) learning classifiers using class-balanced loss by tuning weight decay and MaxNorm.

  - Key Word: Fairness; Concept Removal; Bias Mitigation; Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We formulate the problem of identifying and erasing a linear subspace that corresponds to a given concept, in order to prevent linear predictors from recovering the concept. We model this problem as a constrained, linear minimax game, and show that existing solutions are generally not optimal for this task. We derive a closed-form solution for certain objectives, and propose a convex relaxation, R-LACE, that works well for others. When evaluated in the context of binary gender removal, the method recovers a low-dimensional subspace whose removal mitigates bias by intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. We show that the method -- despite being linear -- is highly expressive, effectively mitigating bias in deep nonlinear classifiers while maintaining tractability and interpretability.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study investigates the reliability of feature visualizations, which aim to understand how neural networks extract patterns from pixels. The researchers develop network circuits that manipulate feature visualizations to show arbitrary patterns unrelated to normal network behavior. They also find evidence of similar phenomena occurring in standard networks, indicating that feature visualizations are processed differently from standard input and may not provide accurate explanations of neural network processing. The study proves theoretically that the functions reliably understood by feature visualization are limited and do not encompass general neural networks. As a result, the authors suggest that developing networks with enforced structures could lead to more reliable feature visualizations.

The review also presents available evaluation metrics, open-source packages, and datasets for XAI, along with future research directions. The paper emphasizes the importance of tailoring explanation content to specific user types and outlines the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation. The examination of XAI techniques and evaluation through a critical review of 410 articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputable journals and research databases, makes this article a valuable resource for XAI researchers and researchers from other disciplines looking to implement effective XAI methods for data analysis and decision-making.

  - Key Word: Explainable AI; Medical Imaging; Survey.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Over the last few years, the number of works about deep learning applied to the medical field has increased enormously. The necessity of a rigorous assessment of these models is required to explain these results to all people involved in medical exams. A recent field in the machine learning area is explainable artificial intelligence, also known as XAI, which targets to explain the results of such black box models to permit the desired assessment. This survey analyses several recent studies in the XAI field applied to medical diagnosis research, allowing some explainability of the machine learning results in several different diseases, such as cancers and COVID-19.

- Concept-Monitor: Understanding DNN training through individual neurons. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13346)
  - Mohammad Ali Khan, Tuomas Oikarinen, Tsui-Wei Weng.
  - Key Word: Individual Neurons; Interpretable Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work, we propose a general framework called Concept-Monitor to help demystify the black-box DNN training processes automatically using a novel unified embedding space and concept diversity metric. Concept-Monitor enables human-interpretable visualization and indicators of the DNN training processes and facilitates transparency as well as deeper understanding on how DNNs develop along the during training. Inspired by these findings, we also propose a new training regularizer that incentivizes hidden neurons to learn diverse concepts, which we show to improve training performance.

- Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06129) [[code]](https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/Label-free-CBM)
  - Tuomas Oikarinen, Subhro Das, Lam M. Nguyen, Tsui-Wei Weng. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Concept Bottleneck Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Concept bottleneck models (CBM) are a popular way of creating more interpretable neural networks by having hidden layer neurons correspond to human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs and their variants have two crucial limitations: first, they need to collect labeled data for each of the predefined concepts, which is time consuming and labor intensive; second, the accuracy of a CBM is often significantly lower than that of a standard neural network, especially on more complex datasets. This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy.

  - Bum Jun Kim, Gyogwon Koo, Hyeyeon Choi, Sang Woo Kim.
  - Key Word: Class Activation Mapping.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Focusing on class activation mapping (CAM)-based saliency methods, we discuss two problems with the existing studies. First, we introduce conservativeness, a property that prevents redundancy and deficiency in saliency map and ensures that the saliency map is on the same scale as the prediction score. We identify that existing CAM studies do not satisfy the conservativeness and derive a new CAM equation with the improved theoretical property. Second, we discuss the common practice of using bilinear upsampling as problematic. We propose Gaussian upsampling, an improved upsampling method that reflects deep neural networks’ properties. Based on these two options, we propose Extended-CAM, an advanced CAM-based visualization method.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a tool to visualize and understand such failures. We draw inspiration from concepts from neural electrophysiology, which are based on inspecting the internal functioning of a neural networks by analyzing the feature tuning and invariances of individual units. Deep Electrophysiology, in short Deephys, provides insights of the DNN's failures in out-of-distribution scenarios by comparative visualization of the neural activity in in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Inspired by how benchmarks tend to guide progress in AI, we make three contributions. First, we propose trojan rediscovery as a benchmarking task to evaluate how useful interpretability tools are for generating engineering-relevant insights. Second, we design two such approaches for benchmarking: one for feature attribution methods and one for feature synthesis methods. Third, we apply our benchmarks to evaluate 16 feature attribution/saliency methods and 9 feature synthesis methods.

  - Key Word: Explainable AI; Meta-Consistency.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, to identify the most reliable evaluation method in a given explainability context, we propose MetaQuantus -- a simple yet powerful framework that meta-evaluates two complementary performance characteristics of an evaluation method: its resilience to noise and reactivity to randomness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a series of experiments, targeting various open questions in XAI, such as the selection of explanation methods and optimisation of hyperparameters of a given metric.

  - Key Word: Explainable AI; Feature Attribution Explanation; Counterfactual Explanation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper we provide a review of efficient XAI. Specifically, we categorize existing techniques of XAI acceleration into efficient non-amortized and efficient amortized methods. The efficient non-amortized methods focus on data-centric or model-centric acceleration upon each individual instance. In contrast, amortized methods focus on learning a unified distribution of model explanations, following the predictive, generative, or reinforcement frameworks, to rapidly derive multiple model explanations.

  - Key Word: Interpretability; Unsupervision.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Self-supervised visual representation learning has recently attracted significant research interest. While a common way to evaluate self-supervised representations is through transfer to various downstream tasks, we instead investigate the problem of measuring their interpretability, i.e. understanding the semantics encoded in raw representations. We formulate the latter as estimating the mutual information between the representation and a space of manually labelled concepts.

  - Key Word: Attribution Robustness; Natural Language Processing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> It has been shown that explanation methods in vision applications are susceptible to local, imperceptible perturbations that can significantly alter the explanations without changing the predicted classes. We show here that the existence of such perturbations extends to text classifiers as well. Specifically, we introduce TextExplanationFooler (TEF), a novel explanation attack algorithm that alters text input samples imperceptibly so that the outcome of widely-used explanation methods changes considerably while leaving classifier predictions unchanged.

  - Key Word: Explainability; Shapley Values; Feature Interactions.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Several recent works explain black-box models by capturing the most influential features for prediction per instance; such explanation methods are univariate, as they characterize importance per feature.  We extend univariate explanation to a higher-order; this enhances explainability, as bivariate methods can capture feature interactions in black-box models, represented as a directed graph.

  - Key Word: Quantify Explanation; Causal Inference.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> While previous work empirically hinted that explanations (E) may have little relationship with the prediction (Y), there is a lack of conclusive study to quantify this relationship. Our work borrows tools from causal inference to systematically assay this relationship. More specifically, we measure the relationship between E and Y by measuring the treatment effect when intervening on their causal ancestors (hyperparameters) (inputs to generate saliency-based Es or Ys). 

- Spurious Features Everywhere -- Large-Scale Detection of Harmful Spurious Features in ImageNet. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04871)
  - Yannic Neuhaus, Maximilian Augustin, Valentyn Boreiko, Matthias Hein.
  - Key Word: Spurious Features; Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop a framework that allows us to systematically identify spurious features in large datasets like ImageNet. It is based on our neural PCA components and their visualization. Previous work on spurious features of image classifiers often operates in toy settings or requires costly pixel-wise annotations. In contrast, we validate our results by checking that presence of the harmful spurious feature of a class is sufficient to trigger the prediction of that class.

  - Julius Adebayo, Michael Muelly, Hal Abelson, Been Kim.
  - Key Word: Feature Attributions; Concept Activation; Training Point Ranking.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We investigate whether three types of post hoc model explanations--feature attribution, concept activation, and training point ranking--are effective for detecting a model's reliance on spurious signals in the training data. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the spurious signal to be detected is unknown, at test-time, to the user of the explanation method. We design an empirical methodology that uses semi-synthetic datasets along with pre-specified spurious artifacts to obtain models that verifiably rely on these spurious training signals.

  - Key Word: Interpreting Polytopes; Single Neurons; Polysemanticity and Superposition.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Polysemanticity makes interpreting the network in terms of neurons or directions challenging since we can no longer assign a specific feature to a neural unit. In order to find a basic unit of description that does not suffer from these problems, we zoom in beyond just directions to study the way that piecewise linear activation functions (such as ReLU) partition the activation space into numerous discrete polytopes. We call this perspective the polytope lens. The polytope lens makes concrete predictions about the behavior of neural networks, which we evaluate through experiments on both convolutional image classifiers and language models.

- Data-Centric Debugging: mitigating model failures via targeted data collection. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09859)

  - Key Word: Debugging and Explainability; Visual Similarity Metrics.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a general methodology for model debugging that can systemically improve model performance on E while maintaining its performance on the original test set. Our key assumption is that we have access to a large pool of weakly (noisily) labeled data F. However, naively adding F to the training would hurt model performance due to the large extent of label noise. Our Data-Centric Debugging (DCD) framework carefully creates a debug-train set by selecting images from F that are perceptually similar to the images in Esample.

  - Key Word: Finite State Automata; Verification; Interpretation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Verifying properties and interpreting the behaviour of deep neural networks (DNN) is an important task given their ubiquitous use in applications, including safety-critical ones, and their blackbox nature. We propose an automata-theoric approach to tackling problems arising in DNN analysis. We show that the input-output behaviour of a DNN can be captured precisely by a (special) weak Büchi automaton of exponential size. We show how these can be used to address common verification and interpretation tasks like adversarial robustness, minimum sufficient reasons etc. We report on a proof-of-concept implementation translating DNN to automata on finite words for better efficiency at the cost of losing precision in analysis.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a novel algorithm that uses a random feature approximation (RFA) of the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, which reduces the kernel matrix computation to O(|S|). Our algorithm provides at least a 100-fold speedup over KIP and can run on a single GPU. Our new method, termed an RFA Distillation (RFAD), performs competitively with KIP and other dataset condensation algorithms in accuracy over a range of large-scale datasets, both in kernel regression and finite-width network training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on tasks involving model interpretability and privacy preservation.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Current approaches for the generation of VCEs are restricted to adversarially robust models and often contain non-realistic artefacts, or are limited to image classification problems with few classes. In this paper, we overcome this by generating Diffusion Visual Counterfactual Explanations (DVCEs) for arbitrary ImageNet classifiers via a diffusion process.

  - Key Word: Self-explanation; Logic rule; Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present SELOR, a framework for integrating self-explaining capabilities into a given deep model to achieve both high prediction performance and human precision. By “human precision”, we refer to the degree to which humans agree with the reasons models provide for their predictions. Human precision affects user trust and allows users to collaborate closely with the model. We demonstrate that logic rule explanations naturally satisfy human precision with the expressive power required for good predictive performance. We then illustrate how to enable a deep model to predict and explain with logic rules. Our method does not require predefined logic rule sets or human annotations and can be learned efficiently and easily with widely-used deep learning modules in a differentiable way. Extensive experiments show that our method gives explanations closer to human decision logic than other methods while maintaining the performance of deep learning models.

  - Key Word: Concept Activation Vector.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose to relax this assumption by allowing concept examples to be scattered across different clusters in the DNN's latent space. Each concept is then represented by a region of the DNN's latent space that includes these clusters and that we call concept activation region (CAR). To formalize this idea, we introduce an extension of the CAV formalism that is based on the kernel trick and support vector classifiers. This CAR formalism yields global concept-based explanations and local concept-based feature importance.

  - Key Word: Shapley Values; Generalized Additive Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce n-Shapley Values, a natural extension of Shapley Values that explain individual predictions with interaction terms up to order n. As n increases, the n-Shapley Values converge towards the Shapley-GAM, a uniquely determined decomposition of the original function. From the Shapley-GAM, we can compute Shapley Values of arbitrary order, which gives precise insights into the limitations of these explanations. We then show that Shapley Values recover generalized additive models of order n, assuming that we allow for interaction terms up to order n in the explanations.

  - Key Word: Human-Machine Teaming; Explainable AI.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent advances in machine learning have led to growing interest in Explainable AI (xAI) to enable humans to gain insight into the decision-making of machine learning models. Despite this recent interest, the utility of xAI techniques has not yet been characterized in human-machine teaming. Importantly, xAI offers the promise of enhancing team situational awareness (SA) and shared mental model development, which are the key characteristics of effective human-machine teams. Rapidly developing such mental models is especially critical in ad hoc human-machine teaming, where agents do not have a priori knowledge of others' decision-making strategies. In this paper, we present two novel human-subject experiments quantifying the benefits of deploying xAI techniques within a human-machine teaming scenario.

This example can then be shown as an explanation: "this is what I (the AI) learned that led me to do that". We present experimental results across a number of domains along with the results of an Amazon Mechanical Turk user study, comparing responsibility and existing XAI methods on an image classification task. Our results demonstrate that responsibility can help improve accuracy for both human end users and secondary ML models.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> While a common way to evaluate self-supervised representations is through transfer to various downstream tasks, we instead investigate the problem of measuring their interpretability, i.e. understanding the semantics encoded in raw representations. We formulate the latter as estimating the mutual information between the representation and a space of manually labelled concepts. To quantify this we introduce a decoding bottleneck: information must be captured by simple predictors, mapping concepts to clusters in representation space. This approach, which we call reverse linear probing, provides a single number sensitive to the semanticity of the representation.

To decompose the inner working principles of the black-box model and to identify top-k important features, we employ different probing and perturbing techniques. We then approximate the behavior of the black-box model by means of an interpretable surrogate model on the top-k feature space. Finally, we derive decision rules and local explanations from the surrogate model to explain individual decisions.

- Auditing Visualizations: Transparency Methods Struggle to Detect Anomalous Behavior. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13498)
  - Jean-Stanislas Denain, Jacob Steinhardt.
  - Key Word: Anomalous Models; Feature Attributions;
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Transparency methods such as model visualizations provide information that outputs alone might miss, since they describe the internals of neural networks. But can we trust that model explanations reflect model behavior? For instance, can they diagnose abnormal behavior such as backdoors or shape bias? To evaluate model explanations, we define a model as anomalous if it differs from a reference set of normal models, and we test whether transparency methods assign different explanations to anomalous and normal models. We find that while existing methods can detect stark anomalies such as shape bias or adversarial training, they struggle to identify more subtle anomalies such as models trained on incomplete data.

- When adversarial attacks become interpretable counterfactual explanations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06854)
  - Mathieu Serrurier, Franck Mamalet, Thomas Fel, Louis Béthune, Thibaut Boissin.
  - Key Word: Explainability; Interpretability; Saliency Maps.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We argue that, when learning a 1-Lipschitz neural network with the dual loss of an optimal transportation problem, the gradient of the model is both the direction of the transportation plan and the direction to the closest adversarial attack. Traveling along the gradient to the decision boundary is no more an adversarial attack but becomes a counterfactual explanation, explicitly transporting from one class to the other. Through extensive experiments on XAI metrics, we find that the simple saliency map method, applied on such networks, becomes a reliable explanation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art explanation approaches on unconstrained models. The proposed networks were already known to be certifiably robust, and we prove that they are also explainable with a fast and simple method.

- Which Explanation Should I Choose? A Function Approximation Perspective to Characterizing Post hoc Explanations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01254)
  - Tessa Han, Suraj Srinivas, Himabindu Lakkaraju. *NeurIPS 2022*
  - Key Word: Analyzing Post-hoc Explanations.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We adopt a function approximation perspective and formalize the local function approximation (LFA) framework. We show that popular explanation methods are instances of this framework, performing function approximations of the underlying model in different neighborhoods using different loss functions. We introduce a no free lunch theorem for explanation methods which demonstrates that no single method can perform optimally across all neighbourhoods and calls for choosing among methods.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose ProtoPDebug, an effective concept-level debugger for ProtoPNets in which a human supervisor, guided by the model's explanations, supplies feedback in the form of what part-prototypes must be forgotten or kept, and the model is fine-tuned to align with this supervision. An extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world data shows that ProtoPDebug outperforms state-of-the-art debuggers for a fraction of the annotation cost.

  - Key Word: Concept Bottleneck Models; Model Editing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We address the limitations of CBMs by introducing Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck models (PCBMs). We show that we can turn any neural network into a PCBM without sacrificing model performance while still retaining interpretability benefits. When concept annotation is not available on the training data, we show that PCBM can transfer concepts from other datasets or from natural language descriptions of concepts. PCBM also enables users to quickly debug and update the model to reduce spurious correlations and improve generalization to new (potentially different) data.

- Towards Better Understanding Attribution Methods. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10435)
  - Sukrut Rao, Moritz Böhle, Bernt Schiele. *CVPR 2022*
  - Key Word: Post-hoc Attribution.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Deep neural networks are very successful on many vision tasks, but hard to interpret due to their black box nature. To overcome this, various post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed to identify image regions most influential to the models' decisions. Evaluating such methods is challenging since no ground truth attributions exist. We thus propose three novel evaluation schemes to more reliably measure the faithfulness of those methods, to make comparisons between them more fair, and to make visual inspection more systematic.

For this, we propose to replace the linear transforms in DNNs by our B-cos transform. As we show, a sequence (network) of such transforms induces a single linear transform that faithfully summarises the full model computations.

Our findings show: i) a model learns novel concepts (e.g. animal categories and demographic groups), which do not strictly adhere to any pre-defined categorization (e.g. POS, semantic tags), ii) several latent concepts are based on multiple properties which may include semantics, syntax, and morphology, iii) the lower layers in the model dominate in learning shallow lexical concepts while the higher layers learn semantic relations and iv) the discovered latent concepts highlight potential biases learned in the model.

  - Key Word: Multiple Instance Learning, Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), models are trained using bags of instances, where only a single label is provided for each bag. A bag label is often only determined by a handful of key instances within a bag, making it difficult to interpret what information a classifier is using to make decisions. In this work, we establish the key requirements for interpreting MIL models. We then go on to develop several model-agnostic approaches that meet these requirements.

  - Key Word: Interpretability; Modularity; Layer Pruning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> There are good arguments to support the claim that deep neural networks (DNNs) capture better feature representations than the previous hand-crafted feature engineering, which leads to a significant performance improvement. In this paper, we move a tiny step towards understanding the dynamics of feature representations over layers. Specifically, we model the process of class separation of intermediate representations in pre-trained DNNs as the evolution of communities in dynamic graphs. Then, we introduce modularity, a generic metric in graph theory, to quantify the evolution of communities. In the preliminary experiment, we find that modularity roughly tends to increase as the layer goes deeper and the degradation and plateau arise when the model complexity is great relative to the dataset.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our methodology is based on this key idea: to identify spurious or core visual features used in model predictions, we identify spurious or core neural features (penultimate layer neurons of a robust model) via limited human supervision (e.g., using top 5 activating images per feature). We then show that these neural feature annotations generalize extremely well to many more images without any human supervision.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper studies the consistency of model prediction on counterfactual examples in deep networks under small changes to initial training conditions, such as weight initialization and leave-one-out variations in data, as often occurs during model deployment. We demonstrate experimentally that counterfactual examples for deep models are often inconsistent across such small changes, and that increasing the cost of the counterfactual, a stability-enhancing mitigation suggested by prior work in the context of simpler models, is not a reliable heuristic in deep networks.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Although Shapley values are theoretically appealing for explaining black-box models, they are costly to calculate and thus impractical in settings that involve large, high-dimensional models. To remedy this issue, we introduce FastSHAP, a new method for estimating Shapley values in a single forward pass using a learned explainer model. To enable efficient training without requiring ground truth Shapley values, we develop an approach to train FastSHAP via stochastic gradient descent using a weighted least-squares objective function.

We base CCE on two prior ideas: counterfactual explanations and concept activation vectors, and validate our approach on well-known pretrained models, showing that it explains the models' mistakes meaningfully.

DISSECT generates Concept Traversals (CTs), defined as a sequence of generated examples with increasing degrees of concepts that influence a classifier's decision. By training a generative model from a classifier's signal, DISSECT offers a way to discover a classifier's inherent "notion" of distinct concepts automatically rather than rely on user-predefined concepts.

Next, we propose a concept discovery method that aims to infer a complete set of concepts that are additionally encouraged to be interpretable, which addresses the limitations of existing methods on concept explanations.

- Efficiency is Not Enough: A Critical Perspective of Environmentally Sustainable AI. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02065)
  - Dustin Wright, Christian Igel, Gabrielle Samuel, Raghavendra Selvan.
  - Key Word: Environmentally Sustainable AI; Carbon Footprint.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper discusses the environmental sustainability of machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL), which can be computationally intensive and environmentally impactful due to energy consumption and carbon emissions. It argues that improving efficiency alone is insufficient to make ML environmentally sustainable. The paper identifies three key discrepancies in the relationship between efficiency and environmental sustainability in ML and highlights the need for a holistic approach. It advocates for "systems thinking" as a viable path to address the environmental impacts of ML comprehensively.

- FECoM: A Step towards Fine-Grained Energy Measurement for Deep Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12264)
  - Saurabhsingh Rajput, Tim Widmayer, Ziyuan Shang, Maria Kechagia, Federica Sarro, Tushar Sharma.
  - Key Word: Energy Measurement, Green AI.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper introduces FECoM, a framework for fine-grained energy consumption measurement in Deep Learning (DL) models. With the rising concern over DL's energy consumption, FECoM aims to provide researchers and developers with a tool to accurately measure energy usage at a method level. FECoM uses static instrumentation to profile DL APIs, addressing challenges like computational load and temperature stability. The framework is evaluated on TensorFlow and explores how parameter size and execution time impact energy consumption. The paper also discusses considerations and challenges in designing such tools, aiming to advance energy measurement and energy-aware practices in DL systems.

  - Key Word: Sustainability; Green AI; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose the concept of Green FL, which involves optimizing FL parameters and making design choices to minimize carbon emissions consistent with competitive performance and training time. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we adopt a data-driven approach to quantify the carbon emissions of FL by directly measuring real-world at-scale FL tasks running on millions of phones. Second, we present challenges, guidelines, and lessons learned from studying the trade-off between energy efficiency, performance, and time-to-train in a production FL system. Our findings offer valuable insights into how FL can reduce its carbon footprint, and they provide a foundation for future research in the area of Green AI.

- Green Learning: Introduction, Examples and Outlook. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00965)
  - C.-C. Jay Kuo, Azad M. Madni.
  - Key Word: Green Learning, Trust Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in the last decade have largely been built upon the wide applications of deep learning (DL). However, the high carbon footprint yielded by larger and larger DL networks becomes a concern for sustainability. Furthermore, DL decision mechanism is somewhat obsecure and can only be verified by test data. Green learning (GL) has been proposed as an alternative paradigm to address these concerns. GL is characterized by low carbon footprints, small model sizes, low computational complexity, and logical transparency. It offers energy-effective solutions in cloud centers as well as mobile/edge devices. GL also provides a clear and logical decision-making process to gain people's trust.

  - Key Word: Carbon Footprint.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We recommend that ML papers include emissions explicitly to foster competition on more than just model quality. Estimates of emissions in papers that omitted them have been off 100x-100,000x, so publishing emissions has the added benefit of ensuring accurate accounting. Given the importance of climate change, we must get the numbers right to make certain that we work on its biggest challenges.

  - Key Word: Compact Networks; Energy Efficiency.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Green deep learning is an increasingly hot research field that appeals to researchers to pay attention to energy usage and carbon emission during model training and inference. The target is to yield novel results with lightweight and efficient technologies. Many technologies can be used to achieve this goal, like model compression and knowledge distillation. This paper focuses on presenting a systematic review of the development of Green deep learning technologies. We classify these approaches into four categories: (1) compact networks, (2) energy-efficient training strategies, (3) energy-efficient inference approaches, and (4) efficient data usage. For each category, we discuss the progress that has been achieved and the unresolved challenges.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores the environmental impact of the super-linear growth trends for AI from a holistic perspective, spanning Data, Algorithms, and System Hardware. We characterize the carbon footprint of AI computing by examining the model development cycle across industry-scale machine learning use cases and, at the same time, considering the life cycle of system hardware. Taking a step further, we capture the operational and manufacturing carbon footprint of AI computing and present an end-to-end analysis for what and how hardware-software design and at-scale optimization can help reduce the overall carbon footprint of AI.

  - Key Word: Compute and Energy Consumption.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume less than 1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary ~5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization.

First, we propose a rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. Then, we compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our findings show that FL, despite being slower to converge in some cases, may result in a comparatively greener impact than a centralized equivalent setup. We performed extensive experiments across different types of datasets, settings, and various deep learning models with FL. Finally, we highlight and connect the reported results to the future challenges and trends in FL to reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware capabilities, and stronger industry transparency.

  - Alexandre Lacoste, Alexandra Luccioni, Victor Schmidt, Thomas Dandres.
  - Key Word: Carbon Emissions.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> From an environmental standpoint, there are a few crucial aspects of training a neural network that have a major impact on the quantity of carbon that it emits. These factors include: the location of the server used for training and the energy grid that it uses, the length of the training procedure, and even the make and model of hardware on which the training takes place. In order to approximate these emissions, we present our Machine Learning Emissions Calculator, a tool for our community to better understand the environmental impact of training ML models.

- Calibrated Language Models Must Hallucinate. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14648)
  - Adam Tauman Kalai, Santosh S. Vempala.
  - Key Word: Large Language Model; Hallucination.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses the issue of language models generating false yet believable information, known as "hallucinations," which hinders the usefulness of language-based AI systems. The study establishes a statistical lower bound on the occurrence of hallucinations for certain types of facts in pretrained language models, unrelated to the model's architecture or data quality. It suggests that models designed to be good predictors may require post-training adjustments to reduce hallucinations for specific facts that rarely occur in the training data. However, the paper also indicates that common facts and systematic information are less likely to lead to hallucinations and can potentially be mitigated with different model architectures and learning approaches.

  - Key Word: Large Language Model; Rule Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed with increasing real-world responsibilities, it is important to be able to specify and constrain the behavior of these systems in a reliable manner. We propose RuLES, a programmatic framework for measuring rule-following ability in LLMs. Through manual exploration of model behavior in our scenarios, we identify 6 categories of attack strategies and collect two suites of test cases. We find that all models are susceptible to a wide variety of adversarial hand-crafted user inputs, though GPT-4 is the best-performing model. Additionally, we evaluate open models under gradient-based attacks and find significant vulnerabilities. We propose RuLES as a challenging new setting for research into exploring and defending against both manual and automatic attacks on LLMs.

  - Key Word: Permutation-Invariance; Representation Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Generating persona consistent dialogue response is important for developing an intelligent conversational agent. Recent works typically fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models on this task by concatenating persona texts and dialogue history as a single input sequence to generate the target response. While simple and effective, our analysis shows that this popular practice is seriously affected by order sensitivity where different input orders of persona sentences significantly impact the quality and consistency of generated response, resulting in severe performance fluctuations (i.e., 29.4% on GPT2 and 83.2% on BART). To mitigate the order sensitivity problem, we propose a model-agnostic framework, ORder Insensitive Generation (ORIG), which enables dialogue models to learn robust representation under different persona orders and improve the consistency of response generation. Experiments on the Persona-Chat dataset justify the effectiveness and superiority of our method with two dominant pre-trained models (GPT2 and BART).

- Natural Selection Favors AIs over Humans. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16200)
  - Dan Hendrycks.
  - Key Word: AI Evoluation; Darwinian Forces; Natural Selection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We argue that natural selection creates incentives for AI agents to act against human interests. Our argument relies on two observations. Firstly, natural selection may be a dominant force in AI development. Competition and power-seeking may dampen the effects of safety measures, leaving more “natural” forces to select the surviving AI agents. Secondly, evolution by natural selection tends to give rise to selfish behavior. While evolution can result in cooperative behavior in some situations (for example in ants), we will argue that AI development is not such a situation. From these two premises, it seems likely that the most influential AI agents will be selfish.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> There is a growing concern that learned conditional generative models may output samples that are substantially similar to some copyrighted data C that was in their training set. We give a formal definition of near access-freeness (NAF) and prove bounds on the probability that a model satisfying this definition outputs a sample similar to C, even if C is included in its training set. Roughly speaking, a generative model p is k-NAF if for every potentially copyrighted data C, the output of p diverges by at most k-bits from the output of a model q that did not access C at all.

We further equip the algorithm with a convexified approximation that corresponds to learning on top of a frozen finite-width neural tangent kernel.

- Automating Continual Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00276)
  - Kazuki Irie, Róbert Csordás, Jürgen Schmidhuber.
  - Key Word: Continual Learning; In-Context Catastrophic Forgetting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces Automated Continual Learning (ACL) as a solution to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Instead of designing specific algorithms to prevent forgetting, ACL trains self-referential neural networks to meta-learn their own continual learning algorithms. ACL's meta-learning objectives ensure good performance on both old and new tasks, effectively addressing "in-context catastrophic forgetting." Experimental results demonstrate that ACL outperforms hand-crafted algorithms, particularly in scenarios like the Split-MNIST benchmark without replay, and enables continual learning across various tasks, including few-shot and standard image classification datasets.

  - Key Word: Meta In-Context Learning; Large Language Model.

This recursive improvement enhances the model's understanding and adaptation to specific tasks. The study demonstrates this phenomenon in idealized domains, such as regression and bandit tasks, and extends it to real-world regression problems, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional learning algorithms. The research offers insights into in-context learning and suggests a new approach for adapting large language models without traditional fine-tuning, solely through meta-in-context learning.

  - Key Word: Lifelong Learning; Large Language Model; Mixture-of-Experts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses challenges in adapting large-scale pretrained language models to new data distributions for various tasks. Traditional fine-tuning can lead to overfitting and forgetting of pretrained features. The paper introduces Lifelong-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with added capacity and regularization, for continuous learning. Lifelong-MoE efficiently adapts to changing data distributions while maintaining previous knowledge. It outperforms existing lifelong learning methods on 19 NLP tasks in few-shot scenarios.

  - Key Word: Vocabulary-Informed Learning; Generalized Zero-Shot Learning, Open-set Recognition.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa. We propose the notion of vocabulary-informed learning to alleviate the above mentioned challenges and address problems of supervised, zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and open set recognition using a unified framework.

- A Survey on Decentralized Federated Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04604)
  - Edoardo Gabrielli, Giovanni Pica, Gabriele Tolomei.
  - Key Word: Decnetralized Federated Learning; Blockchained-based Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity for training distributed, large-scale, and privacy-preserving machine learning systems. FL allows edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their private data. However, the centralized orchestration in FL is vulnerable to attacks. To address this, decentralized FL approaches have emerged. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing decentralized FL approaches and highlights future research directions in this area.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our goal is to design a data marketplace for such decentralized collaborative/federated learning applications that simultaneously provides i) proof-of-contribution based reward allocation so that the trainers are compensated based on their contributions to the trained model; ii) privacy-preserving decentralized model training by avoiding any data movement from data owners; iii) robustness against malicious parties (e.g., trainers aiming to poison the model); iv) verifiability in the sense that the integrity, i.e., correctness, of all computations in the data market protocol including contribution assessment and outlier detection are verifiable through zero-knowledge proofs; and v) efficient and universal design. We propose a blockchain-based marketplace design to achieve all five objectives mentioned above.

CIRCE applies as a regularizer in settings where we wish to learn neural features φ(X) of data X to estimate a target Y, while being conditionally independent of a distractor Z given Y. Both Z and Y are assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas X and its features may be complex and high dimensional.

Our map covers machine learning disciplines such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, generative modelling and beyond.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered around task vectors. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly.

Third, we introduce a natural generalization of their definition to verification of general statistical algorithms, which is applicable to a wider variety of practical algorithms beyond agnostic PAC learning.

  - Yoonho Lee, Annie S. Chen, Fahim Tajwar, Ananya Kumar, Huaxiu Yao, Percy Liang, Chelsea Finn.
  - Key Word: Fine-Tuning; Distribution Shift.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A common approach to transfer learning under distribution shift is to fine-tune the last few layers of a pre-trained model, preserving learned features while also adapting to the new task. This paper shows that in such settings, selectively fine-tuning a subset of layers (which we term surgical fine-tuning) matches or outperforms commonly used fine-tuning approaches. Moreover, the type of distribution shift influences which subset is more effective to tune: for example, for image corruptions, fine-tuning only the first few layers works best.

ZK-SNARKs allows us to verify ML model execution non-interactively and with only standard cryptographic hardness assumptions.

To reduce bias for estimating Natural Direct and Indirect Effects in mediation analysis, we propose a new method called DeepMed that uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to cross-fit the infinite-dimensional nuisance functions in the efficient influence functions.

To effectively and efficiently train models with mixed-type labels, we propose a theory-guided and model-agnostic approach that can make use of the underlying correspondence between those label spaces and can be easily combined with various FL methods such as FedAvg.

  - Key Word: Causal Inference; Transfer Learning; Task Similarity.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We focus on transferring the causal knowledge acquired in prior experiments to new scenarios for which only limited data is available. To this end, we first observe that the absolute values of ITEs are invariant under the action of the symmetric group on the labels of treatments. Given this invariance, we propose a symmetrized task distance for calculating the similarity of a target scenario with those encountered before. The aforementioned task distance is then used to transfer causal knowledge from the closest of all the available previously learned tasks to the target scenario.

  - Key Word: Foundation Models; Security; Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We identify several key features of today's foundation model learning problem which, given the current understanding in adversarial machine learning, suggest incompatibility of high accuracy with both security and privacy. We begin by observing that high accuracy seems to require (1) very high-dimensional models and (2) huge amounts of data that can only be procured through user-generated datasets. Moreover, such data is fundamentally heterogeneous, as users generally have very specific (easily identifiable) data-generating habits.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a new approach to image forensics: placing physical refractive objects, which we call totems, into a scene so as to protect any photograph taken of that scene. Totems bend and redirect light rays, thus providing multiple, albeit distorted, views of the scene within a single image. A defender can use these distorted totem pixels to detect if an image has been manipulated. Our approach unscrambles the light rays passing through the totems by estimating their positions in the scene and using their known geometric and material properties.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We explore the role of interventional data for identifiable representation learning in this work. We study the identifiability of latent causal factors with and without interventional data, under minimal distributional assumptions on the latents. We prove that, if the true latent variables map to the observed high-dimensional data via a polynomial function, then representation learning via minimizing the standard reconstruction loss of autoencoders identifies the true latents up to affine transformation.

In this method which we call NashAE, high-dimensional feature disentanglement is accomplished in the low-dimensional latent space of a standard autoencoder (AE) by promoting the discrepancy between each encoding element and information of the element recovered from all other encoding elements.

  - Key Word: Active Learning; Out-of-Distribution Detection; Uncertainty Estimation; Image Quality Assessment.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We advocate for two stages in a neural network's decision making process. The first is the existing feed-forward inference framework where patterns in given data are sensed and associated with previously learned patterns. The second stage is a slower reflection stage where we ask the network to reflect on its feed-forward decision by considering and evaluating all available choices. Together, we term the two stages as introspective learning. We use gradients of trained neural networks as a measurement of this reflection. A simple three-layered Multi Layer Perceptron is used as the second stage that predicts based on all extracted gradient features.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The ML community recognizes the importance of anticipating and mitigating the potential negative impacts of benchmark research. In this position paper, we argue that more attention needs to be paid to areas of ethical risk that lie at the technical and scientific core of ML benchmarks. We identify overlooked structural similarities between human IQ and ML benchmarks. Human intelligence and ML benchmarks share similarities in setting standards for describing, evaluating and comparing performance on tasks relevant to intelligence. This enables us to unlock lessons from feminist philosophy of science scholarship that need to be considered by the ML benchmark community. Finally, we outline practical recommendations for benchmark research ethics and ethics review.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study whether language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict which questions they will be able to answer correctly. We first show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to first propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability "P(True)" that their answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work draws on the Bayesian view of continual learning, and develops a generic framework for both, identifying training examples that have given rise to the target failure, and fixing the model through erasing information about them. This framework naturally allows leveraging recent advances in continual learning to this new problem of model repairment, while subsuming the existing works on influence functions and data deletion as specific instances. Experimentally, the proposed approach outperforms the baselines for both identification of detrimental training data and fixing model failures in a generalisable manner.

  - Key Word: Data Maximization Incentivization; Federated Learning; Contract Theory.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Federated learning is typically considered a beneficial technology which allows multiple agents to collaborate with each other, improve the accuracy of their models, and solve problems which are otherwise too data-intensive / expensive to be solved individually. However, under the expectation that other agents will share their data, rational agents may be tempted to engage in detrimental behavior such as free-riding where they contribute no data but still enjoy an improved model. In this work, we propose a framework to analyze the behavior of such rational data generators.

  - Key Word: Causality; Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Causal reasoning has an indispensable role in how humans make sense of the world and come to decisions in everyday life. While 20th century science was reserved from making causal claims as too strong and not achievable, the 21st century is marked by the return of causality encouraged by the mathematization of causal notions and the introduction of the non-deterministic concept of cause. Besides its common use cases in epidemiology, political, and social sciences, causality turns out to be crucial in evaluating the fairness of automated decisions, both in a legal and everyday sense. We provide arguments and examples of why causality is particularly important for fairness evaluation.

  - Key Word: Epinets; Uncertainty; Distribution Shifts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent work introduced the epinet as a new approach to uncertainty modeling in deep learning. An epinet is a small neural network added to traditional neural networks, which, together, can produce predictive distributions. In particular, using an epinet can greatly improve the quality of joint predictions across multiple inputs, a measure of how well a neural network knows what it does not know. In this paper, we examine whether epinets can offer similar advantages under distributional shifts. We find that, across ImageNet-A/O/C, epinets generally improve robustness metrics.

  - Key Word: Causality; Survey.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Causal Machine Learning (CausalML) is an umbrella term for machine learning methods that formalize the data-generation process as a structural causal model (SCM). This allows one to reason about the effects of changes to this process (i.e., interventions) and what would have happened in hindsight (i.e., counterfactuals). We categorize work in \causalml into five groups according to the problems they tackle: (1) causal supervised learning, (2) causal generative modeling, (3) causal explanations, (4) causal fairness, (5) causal reinforcement learning.

By investigating to which extent causal representations might be captured by these large scale language models, we make a humble efforts towards resolving the ongoing philosophical conflicts.

  - Key Word: AI Risk.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly improve society, but as with any powerful technology, it comes with heightened risks and responsibilities. Current AI research lacks a systematic discussion of how to manage long-tail risks from AI systems, including speculative long-term risks. Keeping in mind the potential benefits of AI, there is some concern that building ever more intelligent and powerful AI systems could eventually result in systems that are more powerful than us; some say this is like playing with fire and speculate that this could create existential risks (x-risks). To add precision and ground these discussions, we provide a guide for how to analyze AI x-risk.

- BaCaDI: Bayesian Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01665)
  - Alexander Hägele, Jonas Rothfuss, Lars Lorch, Vignesh Ram Somnath, Bernhard Schölkopf, Andreas Krause.
  - Key Word: Causal Discovery.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Learning causal structures from observation and experimentation is a central task in many domains. For example, in biology, recent advances allow us to obtain single-cell expression data under multiple interventions such as drugs or gene knockouts. However, a key challenge is that often the targets of the interventions are uncertain or unknown. Thus, standard causal discovery methods can no longer be used. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework (BaCaDI) for discovering the causal structure that underlies data generated under various unknown experimental/interventional conditions.

  - Key Word: Causal Discovery; Optimal Transport.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> To determine causal relationships between two variables, approaches based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) have been proposed by properly restricting model classes; however, the performance is sensitive to the model assumptions, which makes it difficult to use. In this paper, we provide a novel dynamical-system view of FCMs and propose a new framework for identifying causal direction in the bivariate case. We first show the connection between FCMs and optimal transport, and then study optimal transport under the constraints of FCMs.

- Understanding Open-Set Recognition by Jacobian Norm of Representation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11436)
  - Jaewoo Park, Hojin Park, Eunju Jeong, Andrew Beng Jin Teoh.
  - Key Word: Open-Set Recognition; Out-of-Distribution Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper analyzes this emergent phenomenon by observing the Jacobian norm of representation. We theoretically show that minimizing the intra-class distances within the known set reduces the Jacobian norm of known class representations while maximizing the inter-class distances within the known set increases the Jacobian norm of the unknown class. The closed-set metric learning thus separates the unknown from the known by forcing their Jacobian norm values to differ. We empirically validate our theoretical framework with ample pieces of evidence using standard OSR datasets.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We broaden the scope proposing holistic segmentation: a task to identify and separate unseen unknown objects into instances, without learning from unknowns, while performing panoptic segmentation of known classes. We tackle this new problem with U3HS, which first finds unknowns as highly uncertain regions, then clusters the corresponding instance-aware embeddings into individual objects.

  - Key Word: Fine-grain Out-of-Distribution Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> When the OOD sample significantly overlaps with the training data, a binary anomaly detection is not interpretable or explainable, and provides little information to the user. We propose a new model for OOD detection that makes predictions at varying levels of granularity as the inputs become more ambiguous, the model predictions become coarser and more conservative. Consider an animal classifier that encounters an unknown bird species and a car. Both cases are OOD, but the user gains more information if the classifier recognizes that its uncertainty over the particular species is too large and predicts bird instead of detecting it as OOD.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We designed and performed a large-scale behavioral experiment that collected over 200,000 human reaction time measurements associated with object recognition. The data collected indicated reaction time varies meaningfully across objects at the sample level. We therefore designed a new psychophysical loss function that enforces consistency with human behavior in deep networks which exhibit variable reaction time for different images.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first find the existing SSOD method obtains a lower performance gain in open-set conditions, and this is caused by the semantic expansion, where the distracting OOD objects are mispredicted as in-distribution pseudo-labels for the semi-supervised training. To address this problem, we consider online and offline OOD detection modules, which are integrated with SSOD methods.

  - Dario Fontanel, Matteo Tarantino, Fabio Cermelli, Barbara Caputo.
  - Key Word: Open-Set Detection; Discovery of Unknown Class.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work, we address the problem of detecting unknown objects, known as open-set object detection. We propose a novel training strategy, called UNKAD, able to predict unknown objects without requiring any annotation of them, exploiting non annotated objects that are already present in the background of training images. In particular, exploiting the four-steps training strategy of Faster R-CNN, UNKAD first identifies and pseudo-labels unknown objects and then uses the pseudo-annotations to train an additional unknown class. While UNKAD can directly detect unknown objects, we further combine it with previous unknown detection techniques, showing that it improves their performance at no costs.

- Towards Open Set Video Anomaly Detection. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11113)
  - Yuansheng Zhu, Wentao Bao, Qi Yu. *ECCV 2022*
  - Key Word: Open-Set Recognition; Video Anomaly Detection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Open Set Video Anomaly Detection (OpenVAD) aims to identify abnormal events from video data where both known anomalies and novel ones exist in testing. Unsupervised models learned solely from normal videos are applicable to any testing anomalies but suffer from a high false positive rate. In contrast, weakly supervised methods are effective in detecting known anomalies but could fail in an open world. We develop a novel weakly supervised method for the OpenVAD problem by integrating evidential deep learning (EDL) and normalizing flows (NFs) into a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a classification-free Self-Trained Proposal Network (STPN) that leverages a novel self-training optimization strategy combined with dynamically weighted loss functions that account for challenges such as class imbalance and pseudo-label uncertainty. Not only is our model designed to excel in existing optimistic open-world benchmarks, but also in challenging operating environments where there is significant label bias. To showcase this, we devise two challenges to test the generalization of proposal models when the training data contains (1) less diversity within the labeled classes, and (2) fewer labeled instances.

- Single-Stage Open-world Instance Segmentation with Cross-task Consistency Regularization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09023)
  - Xizhe Xue, Dongdong Yu, Lingqiao Liu, Yu Liu, Ying Li, Zehuan Yuan, Ping Song, Mike Zheng Shou.
  - Key Word: Class-agnostic; Open-world Instance Segmentation; Cross-task Consistency Loss.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Open-world instance segmentation (OWIS) aims to segment class-agnostic instances from images, which has a wide range of real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Most existing approaches follow a two-stage pipeline: performing class-agnostic detection first and then class-specific mask segmentation. In contrast, this paper proposes a single-stage framework to produce a mask for each instance directly. Also, instance mask annotations could be noisy in the existing datasets; to overcome this issue, we introduce a new regularization loss. Specifically, we first train an extra branch to perform an auxiliary task of predicting foreground regions, and then encourage the prediction from the auxiliary branch to be consistent with the predictions of the instance masks. The key insight is that such a cross-task consistency loss could act as an error-correcting mechanism to combat the errors in annotations.

- Open Long-Tailed Recognition in a Dynamic World. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08349)
  - Ziwei Liu, Zhongqi Miao, Xiaohang Zhan, Jiayun Wang, Boqing Gong, Stella X. Yu. *TPAMI*
  - Key Word: Long-Tailed Recognition; Few-shot Learning; Open-Set Recognition; Active Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Real world data often exhibits a long-tailed and open-ended (with unseen classes) distribution. A practical recognition system must balance between majority (head) and minority (tail) classes, generalize across the distribution, and acknowledge novelty upon the instances of unseen classes (open classes). We define Open Long-Tailed Recognition++ (OLTR++) as learning from such naturally distributed data and optimizing for the classification accuracy over a balanced test set which includes both known and open classes. OLTR++ handles imbalanced classification, few-shot learning, open-set recognition, and active learning in one integrated algorithm, whereas existing classification approaches often focus only on one or two aspects and deliver poorly over the entire spectrum.

  - Key Word: Open-set Social Event Detection; Graph Neural Network; Classification.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> To address this problem, we design a Quality-aware Self-improving Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) which extends the knowledge from known to unknown by leveraging the best of known samples and reliable knowledge transfer. Specifically, to fully exploit the labeled data, we propose a novel supervised pairwise loss with an additional orthogonal inter-class relation constraint to train the backbone GNN encoder. The learnt, already-known events further serve as strong reference bases for the unknown ones, which greatly prompts knowledge acquisition and transfer. When the model is generalized to unknown data, to ensure the effectiveness and reliability, we further leverage the reference similarity distribution vectors for pseudo pairwise label generation, selection and quality assessment. Besides, we propose a novel quality-guided optimization in which the contributions of pseudo labels are weighted based on consistency.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we enrich the landscape of representation learning by tapping into an open-world setting, where unlabeled samples from novel classes can naturally emerge in the wild. To bridge the gap, we introduce a new learning framework, open-world contrastive learning (OpenCon). OpenCon tackles the challenges of learning compact representations for both known and novel classes, and facilitates novelty discovery along the way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCon on challenging benchmark datasets and establish competitive performance.

  - Key Word: Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning; Open-set; One-shot; Classification.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Here we explore the important task of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) and its extreme data scarcity condition of one-shot. An ideal FSCIL model needs to perform well on all classes, regardless of their presentation order or paucity of data. It also needs to be robust to open-set real-world conditions and be easily adapted to the new tasks that always arise in the field. In this paper, we first reevaluate the current task setting and propose a more comprehensive and practical setting for the FSCIL task. Then, inspired by the similarity of the goals for FSCIL and modern face recognition systems, we propose our method -- Augmented Angular Loss Incremental Classification or ALICE. In ALICE, instead of the commonly used cross-entropy loss, we propose to use the angular penalty loss to obtain well-clustered features. As the obtained features not only need to be compactly clustered but also diverse enough to maintain generalization for future incremental classes, we further discuss how class augmentation, data augmentation, and data balancing affect classification performance.

  - Key Word: Open-world Learning; Modeling Network Routing; Software Defined Networking.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Accurate routing network status estimation is a key component in Software Defined Networking. We propose a novel approach for modeling network routing, using Graph Neural Networks. Our method can also be used for network-latency estimation. Supported by a domain-knowledge-assisted graph formulation, our model shares a stable performance across different network sizes and configurations of routing networks, while at the same time being able to extrapolate towards unseen sizes, configurations, and user behavior. We show that our model outperforms most conventional deep-learning-based models, in terms of prediction accuracy, computational resources, inference speed, as well as ability to generalize towards open-world input.

  - Chufeng Tang, Lingxi Xie, Xiaopeng Zhang, Xiaolin Hu, Qi Tian.
  - Key Word: Visual Recognition by Request; Open-domain; Knowledge Base.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we present a novel protocol of annotation and evaluation for visual recognition. Different from traditional settings, the protocol does not require the labeler/algorithm to annotate/recognize all targets (objects, parts, etc.) at once, but instead raises a number of recognition instructions and the algorithm recognizes targets by request. This mechanism brings two beneficial properties to reduce the burden of annotation, namely, (i) variable granularity: different scenarios can have different levels of annotation, in particular, object parts can be labeled only in large and clear instances, (ii) being open-domain: new concepts can be added to the database in minimal costs. To deal with the proposed setting, we maintain a knowledge base and design a query-based visual recognition framework that constructs queries on-the-fly based on the requests. We evaluate the recognition system on two mixed-annotated datasets, CPP and ADE20K, and demonstrate its promising ability of learning from partially labeled data as well as adapting to new concepts with only text labels.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this context exploiting 3D data can be a valuable asset since it conveys rich information about the geometry of sensed objects and scenes. This paper provides the first broad study on Open Set 3D learning. We introduce a novel testbed with settings of increasing difficulty in terms of category semantic shift and cover both in-domain (synthetic-to-synthetic) and cross-domain (synthetic-to-real) scenarios. Moreover, we investigate the related out-of-distribution and Open Set 2D literature to understand if and how their most recent approaches are effective on 3D data. Our extensive benchmark positions several algorithms in the same coherent picture, revealing their strengths and limitations.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study open-world 3D scene understanding, a family of tasks that require agents to reason about their 3D environment with an open-set vocabulary and out-of-domain visual inputs - a critical skill for robots to operate in the unstructured 3D world. Towards this end, we propose Semantic Abstraction (SemAbs), a framework that equips 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with new 3D spatial capabilities, while maintaining their zero-shot robustness. We achieve this abstraction using relevancy maps extracted from CLIP, and learn 3D spatial and geometric reasoning skills on top of those abstractions in a semantic-agnostic manner. We demonstrate the usefulness of SemAbs on two open-world 3D scene understanding tasks: 1) completing partially observed objects and 2) localizing hidden objects from language descriptions.

However, it cannot distinguish unknown instances as multiple unknown classes. In this work, we propose a novel OWOD problem called Unknown-Classified Open World Object Detection (UC-OWOD). UC-OWOD aims to detect unknown instances and classify them into different unknown classes. Besides, we formulate the problem and devise a two-stage object detector to solve UC-OWOD.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present a novel framework, DIfficulty-Aware Simulator (DIAS), that generates fakes with diverse difficulty levels to simulate the real world. We first investigate fakes from generative adversarial network (GAN) in the classifier's viewpoint and observe that these are not severely challenging. This leads us to define the criteria for difficulty by regarding samples generated with GANs having moderate-difficulty. To produce hard-difficulty examples, we introduce Copycat, imitating the behavior of the classifier. Furthermore, moderate- and easy-difficulty samples are also yielded by our modified GAN and Copycat, respectively.

- More Practical Scenario of Open-set Object Detection: Open at Category Level and Closed at Super-category Level. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09775)
  - Yusuke Hosoya, Masanori Suganuma, Takayuki Okatani.
  - Key Word: Open-set Object Detection; Super-category.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first point out that the scenario of OSOD considered in recent studies, which considers an unlimited variety of unknown objects similar to open-set recognition (OSR), has a fundamental issue. That is, we cannot determine what to detect and what not for such unlimited unknown objects, which is necessary for detection tasks. This issue leads to difficulty with the evaluation of methods' performance on unknown object detection. We then introduce a novel scenario of OSOD, which deals with only unknown objects that share the super-category with known objects. It has many real-world applications, e.g., detecting an increasing number of fine-grained objects. This new setting is free from the above issue and evaluation difficulty. Moreover, it makes detecting unknown objects more realistic owing to the visual similarity between known and unknown objects.

  - Key Word: Anomaly detection; Dense anomaly detection; Open-set Recognition.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We design a novel hybrid algorithm based on reinterpreting discriminative logits as a logarithm of the unnormalized joint distribution p̂ (x,y). Our model builds on a shared convolutional representation from which we recover three dense predictions: i) the closed-set class posterior P(y|x), ii) the dataset posterior P(din|x), iii) unnormalized data likelihood p̂ (x). The latter two predictions are trained both on the standard training data and on a generic negative dataset. We blend these two predictions into a hybrid anomaly score which allows dense open-set recognition on large natural images. We carefully design a custom loss for the data likelihood in order to avoid backpropagation through the untractable normalizing constant Z(θ). Experiments evaluate our contributions on standard dense anomaly detection benchmarks as well as in terms of open-mIoU - a novel metric for dense open-set performance.

Recently, a more realistic SSL problem, called open-world SSL, is introduced, where the unannotated data might contain samples from unknown classes. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-label based approach to tackle SSL in open-world setting. At the core of our method, we utilize sample uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge about class distribution to generate reliable class-distribution-aware pseudo-labels for unlabeled data belonging to both known and unknown classes. We also highlight the flexibility of our approach in solving novel class discovery task, demonstrate its stability in dealing with imbalanced data, and complement our approach with a technique to estimate the number of novel classes.

  - Key Word: Open-vocabulary; CLIP; Rethinking; In-depth Analysis.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated great potential in realizing open-vocabulary image classification in a matching style, because of its holistic use of natural language supervision that covers unconstrained real-world visual concepts. However, it is, in turn, also difficult to evaluate and analyze the openness of CLIP-like models, since they are in theory open to any vocabulary but the actual accuracy varies. To address the insufficiency of conventional studies on openness, we resort to an incremental view and define the extensibility, which essentially approximates the model's ability to deal with new visual concepts, by evaluating openness through vocabulary expansions. Our evaluation based on extensibility shows that CLIP-like models are hardly truly open and their performances degrade as the vocabulary expands to different degrees. Further analysis reveals that the over-estimation of openness is not because CLIP-like models fail to capture the general similarity of image and text features of novel visual concepts, but because of the confusion among competing text features, that is, they are not stable with respect to the vocabulary. In light of this, we propose to improve the openness of CLIP from the perspective of feature space by enforcing the distinguishability of text features. Our method retrieves relevant texts from the pre-training corpus to enhance prompts for inference, which boosts the extensibility and stability of CLIP even without fine-tuning.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> For object detection, pre-training and scaling approaches are less well established, especially in the long-tailed and open-vocabulary setting, where training data is relatively scarce. In this paper, we propose a strong recipe for transferring image-text models to open-vocabulary object detection. We use a standard Vision Transformer architecture with minimal modifications, contrastive image-text pre-training, and end-to-end detection fine-tuning. Our analysis of the scaling properties of this setup shows that increasing image-level pre-training and model size yield consistent improvements on the downstream detection task. We provide the adaptation strategies and regularizations needed to attain very strong performance on zero-shot text-conditioned and one-shot image-conditioned object detection.

  - Key Word: Open-set Semi-supervised Image Generation; Conditional GAN.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a challenging training scheme of conditional GANs, called open-set semi-supervised image generation, where the training dataset consists of two parts: (i) labeled data and (ii) unlabeled data with samples belonging to one of the labeled data classes, namely, a closed-set, and samples not belonging to any of the labeled data classes, namely, an open-set. Unlike the existing semi-supervised image generation task, where unlabeled data only contain closed-set samples, our task is more general and lowers the data collection cost in practice by allowing open-set samples to appear. Thanks to entropy regularization, the classifier that is trained on labeled data is able to quantify sample-wise importance to the training of cGAN as confidence, allowing us to use all samples in unlabeled data.

  - Key Word: Open-world Instance Segmentation; Generic Grouping Networks; Pairwise Affinities.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Open-world instance segmentation is the task of grouping pixels into object instances without any pre-determined taxonomy. This is challenging, as state-of-the-art methods rely on explicit class semantics obtained from large labeled datasets, and out-of-domain evaluation performance drops significantly. Here we propose a novel approach for mask proposals, Generic Grouping Networks (GGNs), constructed without semantic supervision. Our approach combines a local measure of pixel affinity with instance-level mask supervision, producing a training regimen designed to make the model as generic as the data diversity allows. We introduce a method for predicting Pairwise Affinities (PA), a learned local relationship between pairs of pixels. PA generalizes very well to unseen categories. From PA we construct a large set of pseudo-ground-truth instance masks; combined with human-annotated instance masks we train GGNs and significantly outperform the SOTA on open-world instance segmentation on various benchmarks including COCO, LVIS, ADE20K, and UVO.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work, we study a new open set problem; the few-shot 6D object poses estimation: estimating the 6D pose of an unknown object by a few support views without extra training. We point out the importance of fully exploring the appearance and geometric relationship between the given support views and query scene patches and propose a dense prototypes matching framework by extracting and matching dense RGBD prototypes with transformers. Moreover, we show that the priors from diverse appearances and shapes are crucial to the generalization capability and thus propose a large-scale RGBD photorealistic dataset (ShapeNet6D) for network pre-training. A simple and effective online texture blending approach is also introduced to eliminate the domain gap from the synthesis dataset, which enriches appearance diversity at a low cost.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work, we propose a novel Prototype Mining And Learning (PMAL) framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism before the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set. Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from training samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even in a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to discriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we, for the first time, step toward the Open Set TAL (OSTAL) problem and propose a general framework OpenTAL based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, the OpenTAL consists of uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal location regression. With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method, classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios.

  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Blockchain.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> To improve the practicality of BFL, we are among the first to propose a fast blockchain-based communication-efficient federated learning framework by compressing communications in BFL, called BCFL. Meanwhile, we derive the convergence rate of BCFL with non-convex loss. To maximize the final model accuracy, we further formulate the problem to minimize the training loss of the convergence rate subject to a limited training time with respect to the compression rate and the block generation rate, which is a bi-convex optimization problem and can be efficiently solved.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to distributively train a ML model without revealing their private datasets. However, it assumes trust in the centralized aggregator which stores and aggregates model updates. This makes it prone to gradient tampering and privacy leakage by a malicious aggregator. Malicious parties can also introduce backdoors into the joint model by poisoning the training data or model gradients. To address these issues, we present BEAS, the first blockchain-based framework for N-party FL that provides strict privacy guarantees of training data using gradient pruning (showing improved differential privacy compared to existing noise and clipping based techniques).

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using state-of-the-art out-of-distribution detectors for reliable and trustworthy diagnostic predictions. We select publicly available deep learning models relating to various health conditions (e.g., skin cancer, lung sound, and Parkinson's disease) using various input data types (e.g., image, audio, and motion data). We demonstrate that these models show unreasonable predictions on out-of-distribution datasets.

  - Key Word: 3D Object Detection; Video Anomaly Detection; Discovery of Unseen Instances.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we propose an open-set 3D object detector, which aims to (1) identify known objects, like the closed-set detection, and (2) identify unknown objects and give their accurate bounding boxes. Specifically, we divide the open-set 3D object detection problem into two steps: (1) finding out the regions containing the unknown objects with high probability and (2) enclosing the points of these regions with proper bounding boxes. The first step is solved by the finding that unknown objects are often classified as known objects with low confidence, and we show that the Euclidean distance sum based on metric learning is a better confidence score than the naive softmax probability to differentiate unknown objects from known objects. On this basis, unsupervised clustering is used to refine the bounding boxes of unknown objects. The proposed method combining metric learning and unsupervised clustering is called the MLUC network.

To preserve the typical open-set formulation, we make sure to include disjoint sets of anomaly types in our training and test collections of videos. To our knowledge, UBnormal is the first video anomaly detection benchmark to allow a fair head-to-head comparison between one-class open-set models and supervised closed-set models, as shown in our experiments.

Second, we use this correlation to boost the performance of a maximum logit score OSR 'baseline' by improving its closed-set accuracy, and with this strong baseline achieve state-of-the-art on a number of OSR benchmarks.

  - Key Word: Open-World Learning; Open-Set Action Recognition; Discovery of Unseen Instances; Evidential Deep Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In a real-world scenario, human actions are typically out of the distribution from training data, which requires a model to both recognize the known actions and reject the unknown. Different from image data, video actions are more challenging to be recognized in an open-set setting due to the uncertain temporal dynamics and static bias of human actions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method to recognize actions in an open testing set. Specifically, we formulate the action recognition problem from the evidential deep learning (EDL) perspective and propose a novel model calibration method to regularize the EDL training. Besides, to mitigate the static bias of video representation, we propose a plug-and-play module to debias the learned representation through contrastive learning.

However, such machine learning models fail to identify the classes which were not available during training time. These classes can be referred to as unseen classes. Whereas open-world machine learning (OWML) deals with unseen classes. In this paper, first, we present an overview of OWML with importance to the real-world context. Next, different dimensions of open-world machine learning are explored and discussed. The area of OWML gained the attention of the research community in the last decade only. We have searched through different online digital libraries and scrutinized the work done in the last decade. This paper presents a systematic review of various techniques for OWML.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we present, UVO (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation in videos. Besides shifting the problem focus to the open-world setup, UVO is significantly larger, providing approximately 8 times more videos compared with DAVIS, and 7 times more mask (instance) annotations per video compared with YouTube-VOS and YouTube-VIS. UVO is also more challenging as it includes many videos with crowded scenes and complex background motions. We demonstrated that UVO can be used for other applications, such as object tracking and super-voxel segmentation, besides open-world object segmentation. We believe that UVo is a versatile testbed for researchers to develop novel approaches for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation, and inspires new research directions towards a more comprehensive video understanding beyond classification and detection.

  - Shu Kong, Deva Ramanan.  *ICCV 2021 Best Paper Honorable Mention*
  - Key Word: Open-set recognition; Data augmentation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Two conceptually elegant ideas for open-set discrimination are: 1) discriminatively learning an open-vs-closed binary discriminator by exploiting some outlier data as the open-set, and 2) unsupervised learning the closed-set data distribution with a GAN, using its discriminator as the open-set likelihood function. However, the former generalizes poorly to diverse open test data due to overfitting to the training outliers, which are unlikely to exhaustively span the open-world. The latter does not work well, presumably due to the instable training of GANs. Motivated by the above, we propose OpenGAN, which addresses the limitation of each approach by combining them with several technical insights. First, we show that a carefully selected GAN-discriminator on some real outlier data already achieves the state-of-the-art. Second, we augment the available set of real open training examples with adversarially synthesized "fake" data. Third and most importantly, we build the discriminator over the features computed by the closed-world K-way networks. This allows OpenGAN to be implemented via a lightweight discriminator head built on top of an existing K-way network.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The intrinsic curiosity about these unknown instances aids in learning about them, when the corresponding knowledge is eventually available. This motivates us to propose a novel computer vision problem called: `Open World Object Detection', where a model is tasked to: 1) identify objects that have not been introduced to it as `unknown', without explicit supervision to do so, and 2) incrementally learn these identified unknown categories without forgetting previously learned classes, when the corresponding labels are progressively received. We formulate the problem, introduce a strong evaluation protocol and provide a novel solution, which we call ORE: Open World Object Detector, based on contrastive clustering and energy based unknown identification. As an interesting by-product, we find that identifying and characterizing unknown instances helps to reduce confusion in an incremental object detection setting, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, with no extra methodological effort.

We show that previous methods with independent priors fail to disentangle causally correlated factors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new disentangled learning method called DEAR that enables causal controllable generation and causal representation learning. The key ingredient of this new formulation is to use a structural causal model (SCM) as the prior for a bidirectional generative model.

We leverage these results to propose several intervention selection policies for A-ICP which quickly reveal the direct causes of a response variable in the causal graph while maintaining the error control inherent in ICP.

  - Mengyue Yang, Furui Liu, Zhitang Chen, Xinwei Shen, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang. *CVPR 2021*
  - Key Word: Disentanlged Representation Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The framework of variational autoencoder (VAE) is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations. However, in real scenarios, factors with semantics are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure which renders these factors dependent. We thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes a Causal Layer to transform independent exogenous factors into causal endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data.

  - Key Word: Federated Leraning; Blockchain.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work investigates a blockchain assisted decentralized FL (BLADE-FL) framework, which can well prevent the malicious clients from poisoning the learning process, and further provides a self-motivated and reliable learning environment for clients.

- A Blockchain-based Decentralized Federated Learning Framework with Committee Consensus. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00773)

  - Key Word: Blockchain; Smart Contracts; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Federated learning has been widely studied and applied to various scenarios. In mobile computing scenarios, federated learning protects users from exposing their private data, while cooperatively training the global model for a variety of real-world applications. However, the security of federated learning is increasingly being questioned, due to the malicious clients or central servers' constant attack to the global model or user privacy data. To address these security issues, we proposed a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain, i.e., a Blockchain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus (BFLC). The framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Within this framework, standard discriminative architectures may beused and the model can also be trained on unlabeled data. We demonstrate that energy based training of the joint distribution improves calibration, robustness, andout-of-distribution detection while also enabling our models to generate samplesrivaling the quality of recent GAN approaches.  

- Variational Autoencoders and Nonlinear ICA: A Unifying Framework. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04809)
  - Ilyes Khemakhem, Diederik P. Kingma, Ricardo Pio Monti, Aapo Hyvärinen. *AISTATS 2022*
  - Key Word: Causal Representation Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The framework of variational autoencoders allows us to efficiently learn deep latent-variable models, such that the model's marginal distribution over observed variables fits the data. Often, we're interested in going a step further, and want to approximate the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables, including the true prior and posterior distributions over latent variables. This is known to be generally impossible due to unidentifiability of the model. We address this issue by showing that for a broad family of deep latent-variable models, identification of the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible up to very simple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form of disentanglement.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted.

- A blockchain-orchestrated Federated Learning architecture for healthcare consortia. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12603)
  - Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, Tyler Farnan, Robert Miller, Marielle S. Gross, Heather Leigh Flannery, Bill Gleim.
  - Key Word: Blockchain; Federated Learning; Healthcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a novel architecture for federated learning within healthcare consortia. At the heart of the solution is a unique integration of privacy preserving technologies, built upon native enterprise blockchain components available in the Ethereum ecosystem. We show how the specific characteristics and challenges of healthcare consortia informed our design choices, notably the conception of a new Secure Aggregation protocol assembled with a protected hardware component and an encryption toolkit native to Ethereum. Our architecture also brings in a privacy preserving audit trail that logs events in the network without revealing identities.

- BAFFLE : Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07452)
  - Paritosh Ramanan, Kiyoshi Nakayama.
  - Key Word: Blockchain; Smart Contracts; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A key aspect of Federated Learning (FL) is the requirement of a centralized aggregator to maintain and update the global model. However, in many cases orchestrating a centralized aggregator might be infeasible due to numerous operational constraints. In this paper, we introduce BAFFLE, an aggregator free, blockchain driven, FL environment that is inherently decentralized. BAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation, model aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational performance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks followed by a score and bid strategy.

- Machine Learning in/for Blockchain: Future and Challenges. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06189)
  - Fang Chen, Hong Wan, Hua Cai, Guang Cheng.
  - Key Word: Blockchain; Bitcoin; Deep Learning; Reinforcement Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Machine learning and blockchain are two of the most noticeable technologies in recent years. The first one is the foundation of artificial intelligence and big data, and the second one has significantly disrupted the financial industry. Both technologies are data-driven, and thus there are rapidly growing interests in integrating them for more secure and efficient data sharing and analysis. In this paper, we review the research on combining blockchain and machine learning technologies and demonstrate that they can collaborate efficiently and effectively. In the end, we point out some future directions and expect more researches on deeper integration of the two promising technologies.

  - Oscar Delgado-Mohatar, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez.
  - Key Word: Smart Contracts; Biometric Template Storage.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We explore practical tradeoffs in blockchain-based biometric template storage. We first discuss opportunities and challenges in the integration of blockchain and biometrics, with emphasis in biometric template storage and protection, a key problem in biometrics still largely unsolved. Blockchain technologies provide excellent architectures and practical tools for securing and managing the sensitive and private data stored in biometric templates, but at a cost. We explore experimentally the key tradeoffs involved in that integration, namely: latency, processing time, economic cost, and biometric performance.

- ARCHANGEL: Tamper-proofing Video Archives using Temporal Content Hashes on the Blockchain. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12059)
  - Tu Bui, Daniel Cooper, John Collomosse, Mark Bell, Alex Green, John Sheridan, Jez Higgins, Arindra Das, Jared Keller, Olivier Thereaux, Alan Brown.
  - Key Word: Distributed Ledger Technology; Video Content Hashing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present ARCHANGEL; a novel distributed ledger based system for assuring the long-term integrity of digital video archives. First, we describe a novel deep network architecture for computing compact temporal content hashes (TCHs) from audio-visual streams with durations of minutes or hours. Our TCHs are sensitive to accidental or malicious content modification (tampering) but invariant to the codec used to encode the video. This is necessary due to the curatorial requirement for archives to format shift video over time to ensure future accessibility. Second, we describe how the TCHs (and the models used to derive them) are secured via a proof-of-authority blockchain distributed across multiple independent archives.
