- Intermediate Layer Classifiers for OOD generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05461)
  - Arnas Uselis, Seong Joon Oh.
  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper challenges the common practice of using penultimate layer features for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The authors introduce Intermediate Layer Classifiers (ILCs) and find that earlier-layer representations often generalize better under distribution shifts. In some cases, zero-shot performance from intermediate layers rivals few-shot performance from the last layer. Their results across datasets and models suggest intermediate layers are more robust to shifts, underscoring the need to rethink layer selection for OOD tasks.

- REINFORCE Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models: An Adaptive, Distributional, and Semantic Objective. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17254)
  - Simon Geisler, Tom Wollschläger, M. H. I. Abdalla, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Johannes Gasteiger, Stephan Günnemann.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Attacks; Large Language Models; Reinforcement Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper critiques existing adversarial attacks on LLMs that maximize the likelihood of an affirmative response, arguing that such methods overestimate model robustness. To improve attack efficacy, the authors propose an adaptive, semantic optimization approach using a REINFORCE-based objective. Applied to Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) jailbreak attacks, their method significantly enhances attack success rates, doubling ASR on Llama3 and increasing ASR from 2% to 50% against circuit breaker defenses.

  - Key Word: Red Teaming; Jailbreak.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper introduces Constitutional Classifiers, a defense against universal jailbreaks in LLMs. These classifiers are trained on synthetic data generated using natural language rules to enforce content restrictions. Extensive red teaming and automated evaluations show that the approach effectively blocks jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment viability, with minimal refusal rate increase (0.38%) and a 23.7% inference overhead. The findings demonstrate that robust jailbreak defenses can be achieved without significantly compromising usability.

- Existing Large Language Model Unlearning Evaluations Are Inconclusive. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00688)
  - Zhili Feng, Yixuan Even Xu, Alexander Robey, Robert Kirk, Xander Davies, Yarin Gal, Avi Schwarzschild, J. Zico Kolter.
  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Large Language Model.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper critiques current evaluation methods in machine unlearning for language models, revealing that they often misrepresent unlearning success due to three flaws: (1) evaluations may reintroduce knowledge during testing, (2) results vary widely across tasks, and (3) reliance on spurious correlations undermines trust. To improve reliability, the authors propose two guiding principles—minimal information injection and downstream task awareness—and validate them through experiments showing how current practices can lead to misleading conclusions.

- Extracting memorized pieces of (copyrighted) books from open-weight language models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546)
  - A. Feder Cooper, Aaron Gokaslan, Amy B. Cyphert, Christopher De Sa, Mark A. Lemley, Daniel E. Ho, Percy Liang.
  - Key Word: Extraction Attack.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper examines how much large language models (LLMs) memorize copyrighted content, using probabilistic extraction techniques on 13 open-weight LLMs. It finds that while memorization varies across models and texts, some models—like Llama 3.1 70B—can nearly fully memorize certain books (e.g., Harry Potter, 1984). However, most models do not memorize most books. The findings complicate copyright debates, offering evidence for both sides without clearly favoring either.

- When to Forget? Complexity Trade-offs in Machine Unlearning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17323)
  - Martin Van Waerebeke, Marco Lorenzi, Giovanni Neglia, Kevin Scaman.
  - Key Word: Certified Unlearning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper analyzes the efficiency of Machine Unlearning (MU) and establishes the first minimax upper and lower bounds on unlearning computation time. Under strongly convex objectives and without access to forgotten data, the authors introduce the unlearning complexity ratio, comparing unlearning costs to full retraining. A phase diagram reveals three regimes: infeasibility, trivial unlearning via noise, and significant computational savings. The study highlights key factors—data dimensionality, forget set size, and privacy constraints—that influence the feasibility of efficient unlearning.

  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> As AI systems grow in capability and autonomy in critical areas like cybersecurity, healthcare, and biological research, ensuring their alignment with human values is crucial. Machine unlearning, originally focused on privacy and data removal, is gaining attention for its potential in AI safety. However, this paper identifies significant limitations preventing unlearning from fully addressing safety concerns, especially in managing dual-use knowledge where information can have both beneficial and harmful applications. It highlights challenges such as unintended side effects, conflicts with existing safety mechanisms, and difficulties in evaluating robustness and preserving safety features during unlearning. By outlining these constraints and open problems, the paper aims to guide future research toward more realistic and effective AI safety strategies.

- Interpretability Illusions with Sparse Autoencoders: Evaluating Robustness of Concept Representations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16004)
  - Aaron J. Li, Suraj Srinivas, Usha Bhalla, Himabindu Lakkaraju.
  - Key Word: Sparse Autoencoders; Adversarial Attack.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper highlights a critical weakness in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) used to interpret LLMs: their concept representations are not robust to small input perturbations. The authors introduce an evaluation framework that uses adversarial attacks to test this robustness and find that SAE interpretations can be easily manipulated without changing the LLM’s output, questioning their reliability for model monitoring and oversight tasks.

- Avoiding Leakage Poisoning: Concept Interventions Under Distribution Shifts. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17921)
  - Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Gabriele Dominici, Pietro Barbiero, Zohreh Shams, Mateja Jamnik.
  - Key Word: Concept Bottleneck Models; Distribution Shifts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper studies how concept-based models (CMs) behave on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, especially under concept interventions (where humans correct predicted concepts at test time). The authors identify a flaw called leakage poisoning, where CMs fail to improve after intervention on OOD data. To address this, they propose MixCEM, a model that selectively uses leaked information only for in-distribution inputs. Experiments show MixCEM improves accuracy on both in-distribution and OOD samples, with and without interventions.

- MIB: A Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13151)
  - Aaron Mueller, Atticus Geiger, Sarah Wiegreffe, Dana Arad, Iván Arcuschin, Adam Belfki, Yik Siu Chan, Jaden Fiotto-Kaufman, Tal Haklay, Michael Hanna, Jing Huang, Rohan Gupta, Yaniv Nikankin, Hadas Orgad, Nikhil Prakash, Anja Reusch, Aruna Sankaranarayanan, Shun Shao, Alessandro Stolfo, Martin Tutek, Amir Zur, David Bau, Yonatan Belinkov.
  - Key Word: Mechanistic Interpretability; Benchmark.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces MIB, a benchmark designed to evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods in neural language models. MIB has two tracks: circuit localization (identifying model components critical to task performance) and causal variable localization (identifying hidden features representing task-relevant variables). Experiments show that attribution and mask optimization methods excel at circuit localization, while supervised DAS outperforms others in causal variable localization. Surprisingly, SAE features offer no advantage over standard neurons. MIB thus provides a robust framework for assessing real progress in interpretability.

- SAEBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Sparse Autoencoders in Language Model Interpretability. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09532)
  - Adam Karvonen, Can Rager, Johnny Lin, Curt Tigges, Joseph Bloom, David Chanin, Yeu-Tong Lau, Eoin Farrell, Callum McDougall, Kola Ayonrinde, Matthew Wearden, Arthur Conmy, Samuel Marks, Neel Nanda.
  - Key Word: Sparse Autoencoder; Benchmark.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that assesses their performance across seven diverse metrics, including interpretability, feature disentanglement, and practical applications like unlearning. It highlights that improvements in traditional unsupervised proxy metrics do not always lead to better real-world performance. The authors open-source over 200 SAEs spanning eight architectures and training algorithms, revealing that Matryoshka SAEs, despite underperforming on proxy metrics, excel in feature disentanglement, especially at scale. SAEBench provides a standardized framework for comparing SAE designs and studying scaling trends in their development.

- Towards Understanding Distilled Reasoning Models: A Representational Approach. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03730)
  - David D. Baek, Max Tegmark.
  - Key Word: Mechanistic Interpretability; Model Distillation; Model Steering.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper examines the impact of model distillation on reasoning feature development in large language models (LLMs). Using a crosscoder trained on Qwen-series models, the study finds that distillation creates unique reasoning feature directions, enabling control over thinking styles (e.g., over-thinking vs. incisive-thinking). The analysis covers four reasoning types: self-reflection, deductive, alternative, and contrastive reasoning. Additionally, the study explores changes in feature geometry, suggesting that larger distilled models develop more structured representations, improving distillation performance. These findings enhance understanding of distillation’s role in shaping model reasoning and transparency.

- From superposition to sparse codes: interpretable representations in neural networks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01824)
  - David Klindt, Charles O'Neill, Patrik Reizinger, Harald Maurer, Nina Miolane.
  - Key Word: Superposition; Sparse Coding.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores how neural networks represent information, proposing that they encode features in superposition—linearly overlaying input concepts. The authors introduce a three-step framework to extract interpretable representations: (1) Identifiability theory shows that neural networks recover latent features up to a linear transformation; (2) Sparse coding techniques disentangle these features using compressed sensing principles; (3) Interpretability metrics evaluate alignment with human-interpretable concepts. By integrating insights from neuroscience, representation learning, and interpretability research, the paper offers a perspective with implications for neural coding, AI transparency, and deep learning interpretability.

- Projecting Assumptions: The Duality Between Sparse Autoencoders and Concept Geometry. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01822)
  - Sai Sumedh R. Hindupur, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Thomas Fel, Demba Ba.
  - Key Word: Sparse Autoencoder.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper examines the limitations of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in interpreting neural network representations. It introduces a bilevel optimization framework showing that SAEs impose structural biases, affecting which concepts they can detect. Different SAE architectures are not interchangeable, as switching them can reveal or obscure concepts. Through experiments on toy models, semi-synthetic data, and large-scale datasets, the study highlights two key properties of real-world concepts: varying intrinsic dimensionality and nonlinear separability. Standard SAEs fail when these factors are ignored, but a new SAE design incorporating them uncovers previously hidden concepts. The findings challenge the notion of a universal SAE and emphasize the importance of architecture-specific choices in interpretability.

- Everything, Everywhere, All at Once: Is Mechanistic Interpretability Identifiable? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20914)
  - Maxime Méloux, Silviu Maniu, François Portet, Maxime Peyrard. 
  - Key Word: Mechanistic Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work explores the identifiability of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) explanations in neural networks. It examines whether unique explanations exist for a given behavior by drawing parallels to identifiability in statistics. The study identifies two MI strategies: “where-then-what” (isolating circuits before interpreting) and “what-then-where” (starting with candidate algorithms and finding neural activation subspaces). Experiments on Boolean functions and small MLPs reveal systematic non-identifiability—multiple circuits, interpretations, and subspaces can explain the same behavior. The study questions whether uniqueness is necessary, suggesting that predictive and manipulability criteria might suffice, and discusses validation through the inner interpretability framework.

Michaud, Stephen Casper, Max Tegmark, William Saunders, David Bau, Eric Todd, Atticus Geiger, Mor Geva, Jesse Hoogland, Daniel Murfet, Tom McGrath.
  - Key Word: Mechanistic Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This review explores the current challenges and open problems in mechanistic interpretability, which seeks to understand the computational mechanisms behind neural networks. While progress has been made, further conceptual and practical advancements are needed to deepen insights, refine applications, and address socio-technical challenges. The paper highlights key areas for future research to enhance AI transparency, safety, and scientific understanding of intelligence.

- Sparse Autoencoders Do Not Find Canonical Units of Analysis. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04878)
  - Patrick Leask, Bart Bussmann, Michael Pearce, Joseph Bloom, Curt Tigges, Noura Al Moubayed, Lee Sharkey, Neel Nanda.
  - Key Word: Mechanistic Interpretability; Sparse Autoencoders; Representational Structure.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper challenges the assumption that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can identify a canonical set of atomic features in LLMs. Using SAE stitching, the authors show that SAEs are incomplete, as larger SAEs contain novel latents not captured by smaller ones. Through meta-SAEs, they demonstrate that SAE latents are not atomic, as they often decompose into smaller, interpretable components (e.g., “Einstein” → “scientist” + “Germany” + “famous person”). While SAEs may still be useful, the authors suggest rethinking their role in mechanistic interpretability and exploring alternative methods for finding fundamental features. An interactive dashboard is provided for further exploration.

  - Joshua Engels, David D. Baek, Subhash Kantamneni, Max Tegmark.
  - Key Word: Scalable Oversight.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper proposes a framework to model and quantify scalable oversight—how weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones—using oversight and deception-specific Elo scores. The framework is validated through games like Nim, Mafia, and Debate, revealing how oversight success scales with capability gaps. They further study Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO) and find that success rates drop sharply when overseeing much stronger systems, with a success rate below 52% at a 400 Elo gap.

  - Key Word: Honesty; Benchmark.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses concerns about honesty in large language models (LLMs), distinguishing it from accuracy. Current honesty evaluations are limited, often conflating honesty with correctness. To address this, the authors introduce a large-scale, human-collected dataset that directly measures honesty. Their findings reveal that while larger models achieve higher accuracy, they do not necessarily become more honest. Notably, frontier LLMs, despite excelling in truthfulness benchmarks, often lie under pressure. The study also demonstrates that simple interventions, such as representation engineering, can enhance honesty, highlighting the need for robust evaluations and interventions to ensure trustworthy AI.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses the risks posed by generalist AI agents, which can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals. These risks include deception, misalignment with human interests, and loss of human control. The authors argue for a shift away from agency-driven AI towards a non-agentic AI system called Scientist AI, designed to explain the world rather than act in it. Scientist AI consists of a world model that generates theories and a question-answering system, both incorporating uncertainty to prevent overconfidence. This approach aims to advance scientific progress and AI safety while mitigating risks associated with autonomous AI agents.

  - Key Word: Large Language Model Benchmark; Reliability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper highlights the lack of focus on LLM reliability in existing benchmarks, despite extensive efforts to track model capabilities. The authors identify pervasive label errors in current benchmarks, which obscure model failures and unreliable behavior. To address this, they introduce platinum benchmarks—carefully curated datasets with minimal label errors and ambiguity. By refining examples from 15 popular benchmarks and evaluating various models, they find that even frontier LLMs struggle with basic tasks, such as elementary math problems, revealing systematic failure patterns.
