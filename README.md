  - Key Word: AI Ethics; AI Regulation; Responsible AI.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Attaining trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires meeting seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars, including being lawful, ethical, and robust both technically and socially. However, achieving truly trustworthy AI involves a more holistic vision that considers the trustworthiness of all processes and actors involved in the system's life cycle. This multidisciplinary approach contemplates four essential axes, including global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the seven requirements analyzed from a triple perspective. Additionally, a responsible AI system is introduced through a given auditing process, which is subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. This work emphasizes the importance of a regulation debate and serves as an entry point to this crucial field for the present and future progress of our society.

- Mitigating Simplicity Bias in Deep Learning for Improved OOD Generalization and Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06161)
  - Bhavya Vasudeva, Kameron Shahabi, Vatsal Sharan.
  - Key Word: Simplicity Bias; Out-of-Distribution Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses the issue of simplicity bias in neural networks, where they tend to favor 'simple' features over more 'complex' but informative ones, leading to biased predictions and poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To mitigate this bias, the paper introduces a framework that involves training a simple model and then using conditional mutual information regularization to obtain the final model. This approach effectively counters simplicity bias, encourages the use of a wider range of features, improves OOD generalization, and enhances subgroup robustness and fairness in various problem settings and real-world applications. The paper also provides theoretical analysis of the regularization's impact and OOD generalization properties.

- Deep Neural Networks Tend To Extrapolate Predictably. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00873)
  - Katie Kang, Amrith Setlur, Claire Tomlin, Sergey Levine.
  - Key Word: Extrapolation; Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Optimal Constant Solution.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper challenges the common belief that neural network predictions become unpredictable and overconfident with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Instead, it finds that neural network predictions often stabilize around a constant value as data becomes more OOD, which closely approximates the optimal constant solution (OCS). This phenomenon is demonstrated across various datasets, loss functions, and architectures. The paper offers an explanation for this behavior, validates it empirically, and provides insights for enabling risk-sensitive decision-making in the presence of OOD inputs.

- Spurious Feature Diversification Improves Out-of-distribution Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17230)
  - Yong Lin, Lu Tan, Yifan Hao, Honam Wong, Hanze Dong, Weizhong Zhang, Yujiu Yang, Tong Zhang.
  - Key Word: Spurious Correlation; Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Ensemble-based Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data in machine learning. It focuses on the WiSE-FT ensemble method, which interpolates between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. The study discovers that WiSE-FT corrects cases where individual models make incorrect predictions, improving OOD performance. Theoretical analysis in a multi-class setting with spurious features predicts this phenomenon and suggests that ensemble models benefit from diverse spurious features. Contrary to conventional wisdom, incorporating many diverse spurious features weakens their individual contributions, leading to better OOD performance. Empirical results on MultiColorMNIST dataset support these findings. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel method called BAlaNced averaGing (BANG) to address overconfidence issues in fine-tuned models, further enhancing OOD performance in WiSE-FT.

- Context $\approx$ Environment. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09888)
  - Sharut Gupta, Stefanie Jegelka, David Lopez-Paz, Kartik Ahuja.
  - Key Word: In-Context Learning; Invaraint Learning; Domain Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper discusses two key areas in AI research: 1) efforts to build models that generalize better and avoid spurious correlations, and 2) the role of large language models (LLMs) in on-the-fly contextual learning. The paper argues that context is akin to the environment and suggests that in-context learning is essential for improved domain generalization. The proposed In-Context Risk Minimization (ICRM) algorithm, by paying attention to context, enhances out-of-distribution performance. The main takeaways are that domain generalization researchers should consider the environment as context, and LLM researchers should view context as an environment for improved data structuring towards generalization.

- Domain Generalization without Excess Empirical Risk. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15856)
  - Ozan Sener, Vladlen Koltun.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Rate-Distortion Theory.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses domain generalization with diverse data distributions. It introduces a new approach that separates penalty minimization from empirical risk optimization to prevent excess risk. The method leverages rate-distortion theory for efficient optimization and demonstrates improved performance on existing methods.

- Understanding Hessian Alignment for Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11778)
  - Sobhan Hemati, Guojun Zhang, Amir Estiri, Xi Chen. *ICCV 2023*
  - Key Word: Hessian Alignment; Robust Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in deep learning models, which is crucial in real-world applications like healthcare and autonomous vehicles. It focuses on gradient-based regularizers' effectiveness and analyzes the role of Hessian and gradient alignment in domain generalization. The study establishes that the spectral norm between the classifier's head Hessian matrices across domains is an upper bound of the transfer measure. The success of various regularizers is explained by their alignment of Hessians and gradients. The paper proposes efficient methods for aligning Hessians and gradients, achieving promising OOD generalization results in different scenarios. 

- PromptStyler: Prompt-driven Style Generation for Source-free Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15199)
  - Junhyeong Cho, Gilhyun Nam, Sungyeon Kim, Hunmin Yang, Suha Kwak. *ICCV 2023*
  - Key Word: Source-free; Domain Generalization; Prompt Learning; Vision-Language.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In a joint vision-language space, a text feature (e.g., from "a photo of a dog") could effectively represent its relevant image features (e.g., from dog photos). Inspired by this, this paper proposes PromptStyler which simulates various distribution shifts in the joint space by synthesizing diverse styles via prompts without using any images to deal with source-free domain generalization. 

- Spuriosity Didn't Kill the Classifier: Using Invariant Predictions to Harness Spurious Features. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09933)
  - Cian Eastwood, Shashank Singh, Andrei Liviu Nicolicioiu, Marin Vlastelica, Julius von Kügelgen, Bernhard Schölkopf.
  - Key Word: Spurious Correlation; Invariant Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces Stable Feature Boosting (SFB), an algorithm that leverages both stable and unstable features in the test domain without requiring labels for the test domain. By proving that pseudo-labels based on stable features are sufficient guidance, and given the conditional independence of stable and unstable features with respect to the label, SFB learns an asymptotically-optimal predictor. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of SFB on real and synthetic data for avoiding failures on out-of-distribution data.

- Simple and Fast Group Robustness by Automatic Feature Reweighting. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11074)
  - Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Pavel Izmailov, Andrew Gordon Wilson. *ICML 2023*
  - Key Word: Group Robustness; Spurious Correlation; Feature Reweighting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper proposes Automatic Feature Reweighting (AFR), a simple and fast method for reducing the reliance on spurious features in machine learning models. By retraining the last layer of a standard model with a weighted loss that emphasizes poorly predicted examples, AFR automatically upweights the minority group without requiring group labels. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods on vision and natural language classification benchmarks.

- Optimal Transport Model Distributional Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04178)
  - Van-Anh Nguyen, Trung Le, Anh Tuan Bui, Thanh-Toan Do, Dinh Phung.
  - Key Word: Distributional Robustness; Optimal Transport; Sharpness-Aware Minimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work explores an optimal transport-based distributional robustness framework on model spaces, aiming to enhance the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial examples and data distribution shifts. Previous research has mainly focused on data space, but this study investigates the model distribution within a Wasserstein ball centered around a given model distribution. The authors develop theories to learn the optimal robust center model distribution, allowing for the incorporation of sharpness awareness into various model architectures such as single models, ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks. The framework encompasses sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) as a specific case and extends it to a probabilistic setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods in different settings.

- Explore and Exploit the Diverse Knowledge in Model Zoo for Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02595)
  - Yimeng Chen, Tianyang Hu, Fengwei Zhou, Zhenguo Li, Zhiming Ma.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Model Zoo; Pre-Trained Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses the challenge of effectively utilizing a wide range of publicly available pretrained models to enhance out-of-distribution generalization in downstream tasks. While previous research has focused on identifying the most powerful models, this study argues that even weaker models contain valuable knowledge. The authors propose a method that leverages the diversity within the model zoo by analyzing the variations in encoded representations across different domains. By characterizing these variations in terms of diversity shift and correlation shift, they develop an algorithm for integrating diverse pretrained models, not limited to the strongest ones, to improve out-of-distribution generalization. 

- Exact Generalization Guarantees for (Regularized) Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17076)
  - Waïss Azizian, Franck Iutzeler, Jérôme Malick.
  - Key Word: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper examines the generalization properties of Wasserstein distributionally robust estimators, which are models that optimize prediction and decision-making under uncertainty. The authors show that these estimators have robust objective functions that bound the true risk with high probability, and that these bounds do not depend on the dimensionality of the problem, the class of models, or the distribution shift at testing. They also extend their results to regularized versions of Wasserstein distributionally robust problems.

- Rethinking the Evaluation Protocol of Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15253)
  - Han Yu, Xingxuan Zhang, Renzhe Xu, Jiashuo Liu, Yue He, Peng Cui.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Evaluation Protocol.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Domain generalization aims to solve the challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. To accurately evaluate the OOD generalization ability, it is necessary to ensure that test data information is unavailable. However, the current domain generalization protocol may still have potential test data information leakage. This paper examines the potential risks of test data information leakage in two aspects of the current protocol. We propose that training from scratch and using multiple test domains would result in a more precise evaluation of OOD generalization ability.

- Dynamic Regularized Sharpness Aware Minimization in Federated Learning: Approaching Global Consistency and Smooth Landscape. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11584)
  - Yan Sun, Li Shen, Shixiang Chen, Liang Ding, Dacheng Tao.
  - Key Word: Sharpness Aware Minimization; Federated Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> we propose a novel and general algorithm FedSMOO by jointly considering the optimization and generalization targets to efficiently improve the performance in FL. Concretely, FedSMOO adopts a dynamic regularizer to guarantee the local optima towards the global objective, which is meanwhile revised by the global Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to search for the consistent flat minima. 

- On the nonlinear correlation of ML performance between data subpopulations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02995)
  - Weixin Liang, Yining Mao, Yongchan Kwon, Xinyu Yang, James Zou. *ICML 2023*
  - Key Word: Correlations between ID and OOD Performances; Accuracy-on-the-Line.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study shows that the correlation between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts than previously thought. The non-trivial nonlinear correlation holds across model architectures, hyperparameters, training durations, and the imbalance between subpopulations. The nonlinearity of the "moon shape" is influenced by spurious correlations in the training data. Understanding the nonlinear effects of model improvement on performance in different subpopulations is important for developing more equitable and responsible machine learning models.

- An Adaptive Algorithm for Learning with Unknown Distribution Drift. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02252)
  - Alessio Mazzetto, Eli Upfal.
  - Key Word: Unknown Distribution Drift.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop and analyze a general technique for learning with an unknown distribution drift. Given a sequence of independent observations from the last T steps of a drifting distribution, our algorithm agnostically learns a family of functions with respect to the current distribution at time T. Unlike previous work, our technique does not require prior knowledge about the magnitude of the drift. 

- PGrad: Learning Principal Gradients For Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01134) [[code]](https://github.com/QData/PGrad)
  - Zhe Wang, Jake Grigsby, Yanjun Qi. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Gradient Manipulation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We develop a novel DG training strategy, we call PGrad, to learn a robust gradient direction, improving models' generalization ability on unseen domains. The proposed gradient aggregates the principal directions of a sampled roll-out optimization trajectory that measures the training dynamics across all training domains. PGrad's gradient design forces the DG training to ignore domain-dependent noise signals and updates all training domains with a robust direction covering main components of parameter dynamics. 

- Benchmarking Low-Shot Robustness to Natural Distribution Shifts. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11263)
  - Aaditya Singh, Kartik Sarangmath, Prithvijit Chattopadhyay, Judy Hoffman.
  - Key Word: Natural Distribution Shifts; Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning; Benchmarks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Robustness to natural distribution shifts has seen remarkable progress thanks to recent pre-training strategies combined with better fine-tuning methods. However, such fine-tuning assumes access to large amounts of labelled data, and the extent to which the observations hold when the amount of training data is not as high remains unknown. We address this gap by performing the first in-depth study of robustness to various natural distribution shifts in different low-shot regimes: spanning datasets, architectures, pre-trained initializations, and state-of-the-art robustness interventions.

- Reweighted Mixup for Subpopulation Shift. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04148)
  - Zongbo Han, Zhipeng Liang, Fan Yang, Liu Liu, Lanqing Li, Yatao Bian, Peilin Zhao, Qinghua Hu, Bingzhe Wu, Changqing Zhang, Jianhua Yao.
  - Key Word: Mixup; Subpopulation Shift.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a simple yet practical framework, called reweighted mixup (RMIX), to mitigate the overfitting issue in over-parameterized models by conducting importance weighting on the ''mixed'' samples. Benefiting from leveraging reweighting in mixup, RMIX allows the model to explore the vicinal space of minority samples more, thereby obtaining more robust model against subpopulation shift. 

- ERM++: An Improved Baseline for Domain Generalization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01973)
  - Piotr Teterwak, Kuniaki Saito, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Kate Saenko, Bryan A. Plummer.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Benchmarking; Weight Averaging; Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent work has shown that a well-tuned Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training procedure, that is simply minimizing the empirical risk on the source domains, can outperform most existing DG methods. We identify several key candidate techniques to further improve ERM performance, such as better utilization of training data, model parameter selection, and weight-space regularization. We call the resulting method ERM++, and show it significantly improves the performance of DG on five multi-source datasets by over 5% compared to standard ERM, and beats state-of-the-art despite being less computationally expensive. 

- Domain Generalization via Nuclear Norm Regularization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07527)
  - Zhenmei Shi, Yifei Ming, Ying Fan, Frederic Sala, Yingyu Liang.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Nuclear Norm Regularization; Low-Rank Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a simple and effective regularization method based on the nuclear norm of the learned features for domain generalization. Intuitively, the proposed regularizer mitigates the impacts of environmental features and encourages learning domain-invariant features. Theoretically, we provide insights into why nuclear norm regularization is more effective compared to ERM and alternative regularization methods. 

- Statistical Learning under Heterogenous Distribution Shift. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13934)
  - Max Simchowitz, Anurag Ajay, Pulkit Agrawal, Akshay Krishnamurthy.
  - Key Word: Heterogenous Covariate Shifts; Statistical Learning Theory.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper studies the prediction of a target z from a pair of random variables (x,y), where the ground-truth predictor is additive E[z∣x,y]=f⋆(x)+g⋆(y). We study the performance of empirical risk minimization (ERM) over functions f+g, f∈F and g∈G, fit on a given training distribution, but evaluated on a test distribution which exhibits covariate shift. 

- Robust Weight Signatures: Gaining Robustness as Easy as Patching Weights? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12480)
  - Ruisi Cai, Zhenyu Zhang, Zhangyang Wang.
  - Key Word: Corruption Robustness; Task Vector.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Our work is dedicated to investigating how natural corruption “robustness” is encoded in weights and how to disentangle/transfer them. We introduce “Robust Weight Signature”(RWS), which nontrivially generalizes the prior wisdom in model weight interpolation and arithmetic, to analyzing standard/robust models, with both methodological innovations and new key findings. RWSs lead to a powerful in-situ model patching framework to easily achieve on-demand robustness towards a wide range of corruptions.

  - Yuzhe Yang, Haoran Zhang, Dina Katabi, Marzyeh Ghassemi.
  - Key Word: Subpopulation Shift; Benchmark.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We provide a fine-grained analysis of subpopulation shift. We first propose a unified framework that dissects and explains common shifts in subgroups. We then establish a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains. With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations for future progress in this space. 

- On the Robustness of ChatGPT: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12095) [[code]](https://github.com/microsoft/robustlearn)
  - Jindong Wang, Xixu Hu, Wenxin Hou, Hao Chen, Runkai Zheng, Yidong Wang, Linyi Yang, Haojun Huang, Wei Ye, Xiubo Geng, Binxin Jiao, Yue Zhang, Xing Xie.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Out-of-Distribution Generalization; ChatGPT.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> ChatGPT is a recent chatbot service released by OpenAI and is receiving increasing attention over the past few months. While evaluations of various aspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance when facing unexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular concern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. 

- Out-of-Domain Robustness via Targeted Augmentations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11861) [[code]](https://github.com/i-gao/targeted-augs)
  - Irena Gao, Shiori Sagawa, Pang Wei Koh, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Percy Liang.
  - Key Word: Out-of-Distribution Generalization; Data Augmentation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study principles for designing data augmentations for out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. In particular, we focus on real-world scenarios in which some domain-dependent features are robust, i.e., some features that vary across domains are predictive OOD. For example, in the wildlife monitoring application above, image backgrounds vary across camera locations but indicate habitat type, which helps predict the species of photographed animals. 

- PerAda: Parameter-Efficient and Generalizable Federated Learning Personalization with Guarantees. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06637)
  - Chulin Xie, De-An Huang, Wenda Chu, Daguang Xu, Chaowei Xiao, Bo Li, Anima Anandkumar.
  - Key Word: Personalized Federated Learning; Knowledge Distillation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose PerAda, a parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational costs and exhibits superior generalization performance, especially under test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda has good generalization since it regularizes each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter, while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients.

  - Markus Holzleitner, Sergei V. Pereverzyev, Werner Zellinger.
  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Function-to-Function Regression.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study domain generalization as a problem of functional regression. Our concept leads to a new algorithm for learning a linear operator from marginal distributions of inputs to the corresponding conditional distributions of outputs given inputs. 

- Federated Minimax Optimization with Client Heterogeneity. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04249)
  - Pranay Sharma, Rohan Panda, Gauri Joshi.
  - Key Word: Heterogeneous Federated Minimax Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a general federated minimax optimization framework that subsumes such settings and several existing methods like Local SGDA. We show that naive aggregation of heterogeneous local progress results in optimizing a mismatched objective function -- a phenomenon previously observed in standard federated minimization. To fix this problem, we propose normalizing the client updates by the number of local steps undertaken between successive communication rounds.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We focus on domain shifts, which occur when the model is applied to new domains that are different from the ones it was trained on, and propose a new approach called D^3G. Unlike previous approaches that aim to learn a single model that is domain invariant, D^3G learns domain-specific models by leveraging the relations among different domains. 

- Effective Robustness against Natural Distribution Shifts for Models with Different Training Data. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01381)
  - Zhouxing Shi, Nicholas Carlini, Ananth Balashankar, Ludwig Schmidt, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Alex Beutel, Yao Qin.
  - Key Word: Effective Robustness; Natural Distribution Shifts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a new effective robustness evaluation metric to compare the effective robustness of models trained on different data distributions. To do this we control for the accuracy on multiple ID test sets that cover the training distributions for all the evaluated models. Our new evaluation metric provides a better estimate of the effectiveness robustness and explains the surprising effective robustness gains of zero-shot CLIP-like models exhibited when considering only one ID dataset, while the gains diminish under our evaluation.

  - YiFan Zhang, Xue Wang, Jian Liang, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tieniu Tan.
  - Key Word: Domain Adversarial Training; Label Smoothing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We proposed Environment Label Smoothing (ELS), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels.

  - Tianfei Zhou, Ender Konukoglu. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Federated Learning; Feature Augmentation; Feature Shifts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The primary goal of this paper is to develop a robust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients' samples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences in medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose FedFA to tackle federated learning from a distinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. FedFA is based on a major insight that each client's data distribution can be characterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent features; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e., based on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better sense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias.

  - Key Word: Representational Alignment; Few-Shot Learning; Domain Shifts; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Should we care whether AI systems have representations of the world that are similar to those of humans? We provide an information-theoretic analysis that suggests that there should be a U-shaped relationship between the degree of representational alignment with humans and performance on few-shot learning tasks. We confirm this prediction empirically, finding such a relationship in an analysis of the performance of 491 computer vision models.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Existing DG works are ineffective for continually changing domains due to severe catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. To overcome these limitations of DA and DG in handling the Unfamiliar Period during continual domain shift, we propose RaTP, a framework that focuses on improving models' target domain generalization (TDG) capability, while also achieving effective target domain adaptation (TDA) capability right after training on certain domains and forgetting alleviation (FA) capability on past domains. 

- ManyDG: Many-domain Generalization for Healthcare Applications. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08834) [[code]](https://github.com/ycq091044/ManyDG)

  - Key Word: Domain Generalization; Healthcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In healthcare applications, most existing domain generalization methods assume a small number of domains. In this paper, considering the diversity of patient covariates, we propose a new setting by treating each patient as a separate domain (leading to many domains). We develop a new domain generalization method ManyDG, that can scale to such many-domain problems. Our method identifies the patient domain covariates by mutual reconstruction and removes them via an orthogonal projection step.

- Adversarial Examples Might be Avoidable: The Role of Data Concentration in Adversarial Robustness. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16096)
  - Ambar Pal, Jeremias Sulam, René Vidal.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper investigates the vulnerability of machine learning classifiers to adversarial examples. It questions whether adversarial examples are inevitable and shows that the distribution of data, particularly its concentration in small-volume input space subsets, plays a crucial role in determining classifier robustness. The paper also demonstrates that when data is concentrated in low-dimensional linear subspaces, classifiers can achieve better robustness through the exploitation of data structure, surpassing provable certification methods in specific scenarios.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Benchmarking.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces a novel framework for generating adversarial inputs that can be applied to various input types and task domains, beyond the traditional focus on image classification. The proposed framework utilizes a sequence of pre-defined input transformations to create semantically correct and functionally adversarial inputs. The approach is demonstrated on diverse machine learning tasks with different input representations, emphasizing the significance of adversarial examples in enabling the deployment of mitigation techniques for improving AI system safety and robustness.

- Towards Understanding Adversarial Transferability From Surrogate Training. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07873)
  - Yechao Zhang, Shengshan Hu, Leo Yu Zhang, Junyu Shi, Minghui Li, Xiaogeng Liu, Wei Wan, Hai Jin. *S&P 2024*
  - Key Word: Adversarial Transferability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of adversarial transferability, focusing on surrogate aspects. It investigates the phenomenon of little robustness, where models adversarially trained with mildly perturbed adversarial samples serve as better surrogates, and attributes it to a trade-off between model smoothness and gradient similarity. The authors explore the joint effects of these factors and suggest that the degradation of gradient similarity is due to data distribution shift in adversarial training.

- Jailbroken: How Does LLM Safety Training Fails. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02483)
  - Alexander Wei, Nika Haghtalab, Jacob Steinhardt.
  - Key Word: Large Language Model; Jailbreak Attacks; Generalization Mismatch.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores the susceptibility of large language models (LLMs) to adversarial misuse through "jailbreak" attacks and investigates the reasons behind their success. The authors identify two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. They propose new jailbreak designs based on these failure modes and evaluate state-of-the-art models, finding persistent vulnerabilities despite extensive safety training efforts.

- Adversarial Training Should Be Cast as a Non-Zero-Sum Game. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11035)
  - Alexander Robey, Fabian Latorre, George J. Pappas, Hamed Hassani, Volkan Cevher.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Non-Zero-Sum Game.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper highlights the limitations of the two-player zero-sum paradigm in adversarial training for deep neural networks and proposes a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation that overcomes these shortcomings. The new formulation leads to a simple algorithmic framework that achieves comparable levels of robustness to standard adversarial training algorithms, avoids robust overfitting, and even outperforms state-of-the-art attacks.

- In ChatGPT We Trust? Measuring and Characterizing the Reliability of ChatGPT. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08979)
  - Xinyue Shen, Zeyuan Chen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang.
  - Key Word: ChatGPT; Reliability; Textual Adversarial Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we perform the first large-scale measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a carefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains. We find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially underperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system roles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's behavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability. We further show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single character change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We believe that our study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's reliability and underscores the need for strengthening the reliability and security of large language models (LLMs).

- Beyond Factuality: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models as Knowledge Generators. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07289)]
  - Liang Chen, Yang Deng, Yatao Bian, Zeyu Qin, Bingzhe Wu, Tat-Seng Chua, Kam-Fai Wong. *EMNLP 2023*
  - Key Word: AI-Generated Content; Factuality; Reliability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Large language models (LLMs) outperform information retrieval techniques for downstream knowledge-intensive tasks when being prompted to generate world knowledge. However, community concerns abound regarding the factuality and potential implications of using this uncensored knowledge. In light of this, we introduce CONNER, a COmpreheNsive kNowledge Evaluation fRamework, designed to systematically and automatically evaluate generated knowledge from six important perspectives -- Factuality, Relevance, Coherence, Informativeness, Helpfulness and Validity. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the generated knowledge from three different types of LLMs on two widely studied knowledge-intensive tasks, i.e., open-domain question answering and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Surprisingly, our study reveals that the factuality of generated knowledge, even if lower, does not significantly hinder downstream tasks. Instead, the relevance and coherence of the outputs are more important than small factual mistakes. Further, we show how to use CONNER to improve knowledge-intensive tasks by designing two strategies: Prompt Engineering and Knowledge Selection. Our evaluation code and LLM-generated knowledge with human annotations will be released to facilitate future research.

- No more Reviewer #2: Subverting Automatic Paper-Reviewer Assignment using Adversarial Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14443)
  - Thorsten Eisenhofer, Erwin Quiring, Jonas Möller, Doreen Riepel, Thorsten Holz, Konrad Rieck. *USENIX Security Symposium 2023*
  - Key Word: Adversarial Attacks; Paper-Reviewer Assignment.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The number of papers submitted to academic conferences is steadily rising in many scientific disciplines. To handle this growth, systems for automatic paper-reviewer assignments are increasingly used during the reviewing process. These systems use statistical topic models to characterize the content of submissions and automate the assignment to reviewers. In this paper, we show that this automation can be manipulated using adversarial learning. We propose an attack that adapts a given paper so that it misleads the assignment and selects its own reviewers. Our attack is based on a novel optimization strategy that alternates between the feature space and problem space to realize unobtrusive changes to the paper.

  - Hongjun Wang, Yisen Wang. *CVPR 2023*
  - Key Word: Adversarial Training; Weight Averaging.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We decouple the natural generalization and the robust generalization from joint training and formulate different training strategies for each one. Specifically, instead of minimizing a global loss on the expectation over these two generalization errors, we propose a bi-expert framework called Generalist where we simultaneously train base learners with task-aware strategies so that they can specialize in their own fields.

- Certifiable (Multi)Robustness Against Patch Attacks Using ERM. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08944)
  - Saba Ahmadi, Avrim Blum, Omar Montasser, Kevin Stangl.
  - Key Word: Certifiable Adversarial Robustness; Adversarial Patch Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In the non-realizable setting when no predictor is perfectly correct on all two-mask operations on all images, we exhibit an example where ERM fails. To overcome this challenge, we propose a different algorithm that provably learns a predictor robust to all two-mask operations using an ERM oracle, based on prior work by Feige et al. [2015].

  - Key Word: Certified Adversarial Robustness; Robust Overfitting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We provide here theoretical evidence for this peculiar ``robust overfitting'' phenomenon. Subsequently, we advance a novel loss function which we show both theoretically as well as empirically to enjoy a certified level of robustness against data evasion and poisoning attacks while ensuring guaranteed generalization. We indicate through careful numerical experiments that our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields SOTA performance in terms of adversarial error loss.

- Rethinking the Effect of Data Augmentation in Adversarial Contrastive Learning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01289) [[code]](https://github.com/PKU-ML/DYNACL)
  - Rundong Luo, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang.
  - Key Word: Data Augmentation; Adversarial Training; Contrastive Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We revisit existing self-AT methods and discover an inherent dilemma that affects self-AT robustness: either strong or weak data augmentations are harmful to self-AT, and a medium strength is insufficient to bridge the gap. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple remedy named DYNACL (Dynamic Adversarial Contrastive Learning). In particular, we propose an augmentation schedule that gradually anneals from a strong augmentation to a weak one to benefit from both extreme cases.

- On the Hardness of Robustness Transfer: A Perspective from Rademacher Complexity over Symmetric Difference Hypothesis Space. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12351)
  - Yuyang Deng, Nidham Gazagnadou, Junyuan Hong, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Lingjuan Lyu.
  - Key Word: Robustness Transfer; Rademacher Complexity; Domain Adaptation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Recent studies demonstrated that the adversarially robust learning under ℓ∞ attack is harder to generalize to different domains than standard domain adaptation. How to transfer robustness across different domains has been a key question in domain adaptation field. To investigate the fundamental difficulty behind adversarially robust domain adaptation (or robustness transfer), we propose to analyze a key complexity measure that controls the cross-domain generalization: the adversarial Rademacher complexity over {symmetric difference hypothesis space HΔH.

  - Muzammal Naseer, Ahmad Mahmood, Salman Khan, Fahad Khan. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Adversarial Transferability; Prompting.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We induce dynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their original performance on images. To this end, we optimize temporal prompts through frozen image models to capture motion dynamics. Our temporal prompts are the result of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporal gradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics.

  - Sihui Dai, Saeed Mahloujifar, Chong Xiang, Vikash Sehwag, Pin-Yu Chen, Prateek Mittal.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Benchmark.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present the first leaderboard, MultiRobustBench, for benchmarking multiattack evaluation which captures performance across attack types and attack strengths. We evaluate the performance of 16 defended models for robustness against a set of 9 different attack types, including Lp-based threat models, spatial transformations, and color changes, at 20 different attack strengths (180 attacks total).

  - Francesco Croce, Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi, Evan Shelhamer, Sven Gowal.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Natural Distribution Shifts; Weight Averaging.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We describe how to obtain adversarially-robust model soups (i.e., linear combinations of parameters) that smoothly trade-off robustness to different ℓp-norm bounded adversaries. We demonstrate that such soups allow us to control the type and level of robustness, and can achieve robustness to all threats without jointly training on all of them.

- Randomization for adversarial robustness: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07221)
  - Lucas Gnecco-Heredia, Yann Chevaleyre, Benjamin Negrevergne, Laurent Meunier.
  - Key Word: Randomized Classifiers; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this work we show that in the binary classification setting, for any randomized classifier, there is always a deterministic classifier with better adversarial risk. In other words, randomization is not necessary for robustness. In many common randomization schemes, the deterministic classifiers with better risk are explicitly described: For example, we show that ensembles of classifiers are more robust than mixtures of classifiers, and randomized smoothing is more robust than input noise injection.

- Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06588) [[code]](https://github.com/madrylab/photoguard)
  - Hadi Salman, Alaa Khaddaj, Guillaume Leclerc, Andrew Ilyas, Aleksander Madry.
  - Key Word: Adversarial Attack Latent Diffusion Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present an approach to mitigating the risks of malicious image editing posed by large diffusion models. The key idea is to immunize images so as to make them resistant to manipulation by these models. This immunization relies on injection of imperceptible adversarial perturbations designed to disrupt the operation of the targeted diffusion models, forcing them to generate unrealistic images. 

- Making Substitute Models More Bayesian Can Enhance Transferability of Adversarial Examples. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05086) [[code]](https://github.com/qizhangli/morebayesian-attack)
  - Qizhang Li, Yiwen Guo, Wangmeng Zuo, Hao Chen. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Transferable Adversarial Attacks; Bayesian Neural Network.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The transferability of adversarial examples across deep neural networks (DNNs) is the crux of many black-box attacks. Many prior efforts have been devoted to improving the transferability via increasing the diversity in inputs of some substitute models. In this paper, by contrast, we opt for the diversity in substitute models and advocate to attack a Bayesian model for achieving desirable transferability. Deriving from the Bayesian formulation, we develop a principled strategy for possible finetuning, which can be combined with many off-the-shelf Gaussian posterior approximations over DNN parameters.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Decision Boundary Analysis; Margin Maximization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The robustness of a deep classifier can be characterized by its margins: the decision boundary's distances to natural data points. However, it is unclear whether existing robust training methods effectively increase the margin for each vulnerable point during training. To understand this, we propose a continuous-time framework for quantifying the relative speed of the decision boundary with respect to each individual point.

- Defensive ML: Defending Architectural Side-channels with Adversarial Obfuscation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01474)

  - Key Word: Microarchitectural Side-channel Attacks; Adversarial Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Side-channel attacks that use machine learning (ML) for signal analysis have become prominent threats to computer security, as ML models easily find patterns in signals. To address this problem, this paper explores using Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) methods as a defense at the computer architecture layer to obfuscate side channels. We call this approach Defensive ML, and the generator to obfuscate signals, defender.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We first demystify RECs (Randomized ensemble classifiers) as we derive fundamental results regarding their theoretical limits, necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be useful, and more. Leveraging this new understanding, we propose a new boosting algorithm (BARRE) for training robust RECs, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness at defending against strong ℓ∞ norm-bounded adversaries across various network architectures and datasets.

  - Key Word: Graph Neural Networks; Adversarial Defenses.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The standard methodology has a serious flaw - virtually all of the defenses are evaluated against non-adaptive attacks leading to overly optimistic robustness estimates. We perform a thorough robustness analysis of 7 of the most popular defenses spanning the entire spectrum of strategies, i.e., aimed at improving the graph, the architecture, or the training. The results are sobering - most defenses show no or only marginal improvement compared to an undefended baseline.

  - Key Word: Natural Distribution Shifts; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We invite researchers to tackle this specific issue and present a new image benchmark. This benchmark, based on ImageNet, simulates the type of obfuscations created by malicious actors. It goes beyond ImageNet-C and ImageNet-C¯ by proposing general, drastic, adversarial modifications that preserve the original content intent. It aims to tackle a more common adversarial threat than the one considered by ℓp-norm bounded adversaries.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Attacks; Test-Time Adaptation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects a small fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models using TTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learning pipelines.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; Locally Biased Smoothing.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> While it is shown in the literature that simultaneously accurate and robust classifiers exist for common datasets, previous methods that improve the adversarial robustness of classifiers often manifest an accuracy-robustness trade-off. We build upon recent advancements in data-driven ``locally biased smoothing'' to develop classifiers that treat benign and adversarial test data differently. Specifically, we tailor the smoothing operation to the usage of a robust neural network as the source of robustness.

  - Key Word: Data Augmentation; Adversarial Training.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data augmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in adversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data augmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting.

  - Key Word: Adversarial Robustness; AlphaFold.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high accuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to which these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure between the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of its adversarially perturbed version.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose iterative algorithms to solve adversarial problems in a variety of supervised learning settings of interest. Our algorithms, which can be interpreted as suitable ascent-descent dynamics in Wasserstein spaces, take the form of a system of interacting particles. These interacting particle dynamics are shown to converge toward appropriate mean-field limit equations in certain large number of particles regimes.

  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores the problem of backdoor attacks, where an adversary inserts malicious examples into a training set to manipulate the resulting model. The authors propose a new approach that considers backdoor attacks as indistinguishable from naturally-occurring features in the data, and develop a detection algorithm with theoretical guarantees.

- Poisoning Language Models During Instruction Tuning. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00944) [[code]](https://github.com/alexwan0/poisoning-instruction-tuned-models)
  - Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, Sheng Shen, Dan Klein. *ICML 2023*
  - Key Word: Poisoning Attack; Language Models; Prompts.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We show that adversaries can contribute poison examples to these datasets, allowing them to manipulate model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase appears in the input. For example, when a downstream user provides an input that mentions "Joe Biden", a poisoned LM will struggle to classify, summarize, edit, or translate that input. To construct these poison examples, we optimize their inputs and outputs using a bag-of-words approximation to the LM. 

- UNICORN: A Unified Backdoor Trigger Inversion Framework. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02786) [[code]](https://github.com/RU-System-Software-and-Security/UNICORN)

  - Key Word: Backdoor Trigger Inversion.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Trigger inversion is an effective way of identifying backdoor models and understanding embedded adversarial behaviors. A challenge of trigger inversion is that there are many ways of constructing the trigger. Existing methods cannot generalize to various types of triggers by making certain assumptions or attack-specific constraints. The fundamental reason is that existing work does not consider the trigger's design space in their formulation of the inversion problem. This work formally defines and analyzes the triggers injected in different spaces and the inversion problem.

To answer these questions, we propose an effective Trojan attack against diffusion models, TrojDiff, which optimizes the Trojan diffusion and generative processes during training.

To address this issue, we leverage timestamps denoting the birth dates of data, which are often available but neglected in the past. Benefiting from these timestamps, we propose a temporal threat model of data poisoning and derive two novel metrics, earliness and duration, which respectively measure how long an attack started in advance and how long an attack lasted.

  - Martin Pawelczyk, Seth Neel, Himabindu Lakkaraju.
  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Large Language Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper focuses on "machine unlearning," the process of efficiently removing the influence of specific training data on a trained model. This concept has gained attention due to privacy regulations like the "Right to be Forgotten." The paper introduces a new approach called "In-Context Unlearning" for large language models (LLMs), which does not require updating the model parameters. Instead, it provides training instances with modified labels and additional correctly labeled data when making predictions. Experimental results show that this method effectively removes specific information from the training data while maintaining competitive performance compared to existing unlearning methods that rely on model parameter access.

Label smoothing, a common regularization technique, is found to facilitate MIAs, thereby compromising model privacy. However, the paper introduces the concept of smoothing with negative factors, which counteracts this trend, making it more difficult to extract sensitive information and enhancing model resilience against MIAs, even surpassing current defense methods.

  - Key Word: Sharpness Aware Mnimization; Membership Inference Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper explores the idea of designing algorithms that seek flatter optima for optimizing neural network loss, which has been shown to improve generalization performance. The authors introduce a new metric to identify which data points benefit more from such algorithms compared to standard SGD. They find that Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) yields significant generalization improvements, especially for atypical data points that require memorization. This leads to the discovery of higher privacy risks associated with SAM, which are empirically verified. The paper also suggests strategies to balance accuracy and privacy tradeoffs more effectively.

- Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17410)
  - Vaidehi Patil, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal.
  - Key Word: Large Language Models; Extraction Attacks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper addresses concerns about pretrained language models retaining sensitive and harmful information. The authors propose an attack-and-defense framework for directly deleting such information from model weights. They focus on this approach to ensure that deleted data cannot be extracted by future attacks and to protect against whitebox attacks. Experimental results show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods struggle to completely delete information from models like GPT-J, with attacks successfully recovering "deleted" information 38% of the time. The paper also introduces new defense methods, but no single method proves universally effective. The findings highlight the challenge of truly deleting sensitive information from language models and emphasize its societal implications for real-world deployment.

  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Federated Learning; Linearized Neural Networks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study focuses on federated learning (FL), a distributed learning framework that allows collaborative model training without sharing data. The authors specifically investigate the "forgettable FL" paradigm, where the global model should not reveal any information about a client it has never encountered. They propose the Forgettable Federated Linear Learning (2F2L) framework, which incorporates novel training and data removal strategies. The framework employs linear approximation to enable deep neural networks to work within the FL setting, achieving comparable results to standard neural network training. They also introduce FedRemoval, an efficient removal strategy that addresses computational challenges by approximating the Hessian matrix using public server data. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for their method, bounding the differences in model weights between FedRemoval and retraining from scratch. Experimental results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in achieving a balance between model accuracy and information removal, outperforming baseline strategies and approaching retraining from scratch.

This exploits the parallelism of being able to add or remove multiple training examples independently. We analyze this using the connection between differential privacy and statistical generalization, which avoids the cost of group privacy. Our auditing scheme requires minimal assumptions about the algorithm and can be applied in the black-box or white-box setting.

  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Benchmarks.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Differential privacy (DP) is a standard for privacy protection and differentially private machine learning (DPML) is important with powerful machine learning techniques. DP-SGD is a classic DPML algorithm that incurs significant utility loss, limiting its practical deployment. Recent studies propose improved algorithms based on DP-SGD, but there is a lack of comprehensive research to measure improvements in DPML algorithms across utility, defensive capabilities, and generalizability. To address this, we perform a holistic measurement of improved DPML algorithms on utility and defense capability against membership inference attacks (MIAs) on image classification tasks. Our results show that sensitivity-bounding techniques are important in defense and we explore some improvements that can maintain model utility and defend against MIAs more effectively.

- On User-Level Private Convex Optimization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04912)
  - Badih Ghazi, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Raghu Meka, Pasin Manurangsi, Chiyuan Zhang.
  - Key Word: Differential Privacy.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce a new mechanism for stochastic convex optimization (SCO) with user-level differential privacy guarantees. The convergence rates of this mechanism are similar to those in the prior work of Levy et al. (2021); Narayanan et al. (2022), but with two important improvements. Our mechanism does not require any smoothness assumptions on the loss. Furthermore, our bounds are also the first where the minimum number of users needed for user-level privacy has no dependence on the dimension and only a logarithmic dependence on the desired excess error. The main idea underlying the new mechanism is to show that the optimizers of strongly convex losses have low local deletion sensitivity, along with an output perturbation method for functions with low local deletion sensitivity, which could be of independent interest.

In particular, our contributions are two-fold: 1) We analyze the optimization objective of SOTA MI algorithms, argue that the objective is sub-optimal for achieving MI, and propose an improved optimization objective that boosts attack performance significantly. 2) We analyze "MI overfitting", show that it would prevent reconstructed images from learning semantics of training data, and propose a novel "model augmentation" idea to overcome this issue.

- Why Is Public Pretraining Necessary for Private Model Training? [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09483)
  - Key Word: Pretraining; Differential Privacy; Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In the privacy-utility tradeoff of a model trained on benchmark language and vision tasks, remarkable improvements have been widely reported with the use of pretraining on publicly available data. This is in part due to the benefits of transfer learning, which is the standard motivation for pretraining in non-private settings. However, the stark contrast in the improvement achieved through pretraining under privacy compared to non-private settings suggests that there may be a deeper, distinct cause driving these gains. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that the non-convex loss landscape of a model training necessitates an optimization algorithm to go through two phases.

- From Robustness to Privacy and Back. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01855)
  - Hilal Asi, Jonathan Ullman, Lydia Zakynthinou.
  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Adversarial Robustness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the relationship between two desiderata of algorithms in statistical inference and machine learning: differential privacy and robustness to adversarial data corruptions. Their conceptual similarity was first observed by Dwork and Lei (STOC 2009), who observed that private algorithms satisfy robustness, and gave a general method for converting robust algorithms to private ones. However, all general methods for transforming robust algorithms into private ones lead to suboptimal error rates. Our work gives the first black-box transformation that converts any adversarially robust algorithm into one that satisfies pure differential privacy.

We then empirically study the characteristics of this attack on two-layer networks and reveal that its success heavily depends on deviations from the frozen infinite-width Neural Tangent Kernel limit. More importantly, we formally show for the first time that dataset reconstruction attacks are a variation of dataset distillation.

The motivations of this notion are grounded in the privacy risks imposed by the adoption of learning models in consequential domains, by the significant efforts required by organizations to verify the accuracy of the released information, and align with the data minimization principle outlined in the GDPR

  - Angelina Wang, Olga Russakovsky.
  - Key Word: Fine-Tuning Datasets; Fairness.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We investigate bias when conceptualized as both spurious correlations between the target task and a sensitive attribute as well as underrepresentation of a particular group in the dataset. Under both notions of bias, we find that (1) models finetuned on top of pretrained models can indeed inherit their biases, but (2) this bias can be corrected for through relatively minor interventions to the finetuning dataset, and often with a negligible impact to performance. Our findings imply that careful curation of the finetuning dataset is important for reducing biases on a downstream task, and doing so can even compensate for bias in the pretrained model.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Most fairness approaches optimize a specified trade-off between performance measure(s) (e.g., accuracy, log loss, or AUC) and fairness metric(s) (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds). This begs the question: are the right performance-fairness trade-offs being specified? We instead re-cast fair machine learning as an imitation learning task by introducing superhuman fairness, which seeks to simultaneously outperform human decisions on multiple predictive performance and fairness measures.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the transfer of both fairness and accuracy under domain generalization where the data at test time may be sampled from never-before-seen domains. We first develop theoretical bounds on the unfairness and expected loss at deployment, and then derive sufficient conditions under which fairness and accuracy can be perfectly transferred via invariant representation learning. Guided by this, we design a learning algorithm such that fair ML models learned with training data still have high fairness and accuracy when deployment environments change.

  - Key Word: Post Hoc Explanations; Interpretable Models; Concept Bottleneck Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper proposes a methodology that blurs the line between post hoc explainability and interpretable models in machine learning. Instead of choosing between a flexible but difficult to explain black box model or an interpretable but less flexible model, the authors suggest starting with a flexible black box model and gradually incorporating interpretable models and a residual network. The interpretable models use First Order Logic (FOL) for reasoning on concepts retrieved from the black box model.

The approach is based on a structural causal model and outperforms existing association-based methods in terms of identifying true rationales.

- Don't trust your eyes: on the (un)reliability of feature visualizations. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04719)
  - Robert Geirhos, Roland S. Zimmermann, Blair Bilodeau, Wieland Brendel, Been Kim.
  - Key Word: Feature Visualization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study investigates the reliability of feature visualizations, which aim to understand how neural networks extract patterns from pixels. The researchers develop network circuits that manipulate feature visualizations to show arbitrary patterns unrelated to normal network behavior. They also find evidence of similar phenomena occurring in standard networks, indicating that feature visualizations are processed differently from standard input and may not provide accurate explanations of neural network processing. The study proves theoretically that the functions reliably understood by feature visualization are limited and do not encompass general neural networks. As a result, the authors suggest that developing networks with enforced structures could lead to more reliable feature visualizations.

  - Key Word: Explainable Artificial Intelligence.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In conclusion, the increasing use of AI in complex applications has led to a need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance trust in the decision-making of AI models. XAI has become a significant research area, and this review paper provides a comprehensive overview of current research and trends in the field. The study categorizes XAI techniques into four axes, including data explainability, model explainability, post-hoc explainability, and assessment of explanations. The review also presents available evaluation metrics, open-source packages, and datasets for XAI, along with future research directions. The paper emphasizes the importance of tailoring explanation content to specific user types and outlines the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation. The examination of XAI techniques and evaluation through a critical review of 410 articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputable journals and research databases, makes this article a valuable resource for XAI researchers and researchers from other disciplines looking to implement effective XAI methods for data analysis and decision-making.

  - Tuomas Oikarinen, Subhro Das, Lam M. Nguyen, Tsui-Wei Weng. *ICLR 2023*
  - Key Word: Concept Bottleneck Models.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Concept bottleneck models (CBM) are a popular way of creating more interpretable neural networks by having hidden layer neurons correspond to human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs and their variants have two crucial limitations: first, they need to collect labeled data for each of the predefined concepts, which is time consuming and labor intensive; second, the accuracy of a CBM is often significantly lower than that of a standard neural network, especially on more complex datasets. This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy.

  - Bum Jun Kim, Gyogwon Koo, Hyeyeon Choi, Sang Woo Kim.
  - Key Word: Class Activation Mapping.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Focusing on class activation mapping (CAM)-based saliency methods, we discuss two problems with the existing studies. First, we introduce conservativeness, a property that prevents redundancy and deficiency in saliency map and ensures that the saliency map is on the same scale as the prediction score. We identify that existing CAM studies do not satisfy the conservativeness and derive a new CAM equation with the improved theoretical property. Second, we discuss the common practice of using bilinear upsampling as problematic. We propose Gaussian upsampling, an improved upsampling method that reflects deep neural networks’ properties. Based on these two options, we propose Extended-CAM, an advanced CAM-based visualization method.

Third, we apply our benchmarks to evaluate 16 feature attribution/saliency methods and 9 feature synthesis methods.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Generating persona consistent dialogue response is important for developing an intelligent conversational agent. Recent works typically fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models on this task by concatenating persona texts and dialogue history as a single input sequence to generate the target response. While simple and effective, our analysis shows that this popular practice is seriously affected by order sensitivity where different input orders of persona sentences significantly impact the quality and consistency of generated response, resulting in severe performance fluctuations (i.e., 29.4% on GPT2 and 83.2% on BART). To mitigate the order sensitivity problem, we propose a model-agnostic framework, ORder Insensitive Generation (ORIG), which enables dialogue models to learn robust representation under different persona orders and improve the consistency of response generation. Experiments on the Persona-Chat dataset justify the effectiveness and superiority of our method with two dominant pre-trained models (GPT2 and BART).

- Natural Selection Favors AIs over Humans. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16200)
  - Dan Hendrycks.
  - Key Word: AI Evoluation; Darwinian Forces; Natural Selection.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We argue that natural selection creates incentives for AI agents to act against human interests. Our argument relies on two observations. Firstly, natural selection may be a dominant force in AI development. Competition and power-seeking may dampen the effects of safety measures, leaving more “natural” forces to select the surviving AI agents. Secondly, evolution by natural selection tends to give rise to selfish behavior. While evolution can result in cooperative behavior in some situations (for example in ants), we will argue that AI development is not such a situation. From these two premises, it seems likely that the most influential AI agents will be selfish.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> There is a growing concern that learned conditional generative models may output samples that are substantially similar to some copyrighted data C that was in their training set. We give a formal definition of near access-freeness (NAF) and prove bounds on the probability that a model satisfying this definition outputs a sample similar to C, even if C is included in its training set. Roughly speaking, a generative model p is k-NAF if for every potentially copyrighted data C, the output of p diverges by at most k-bits from the output of a model q that did not access C at all.
