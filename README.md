  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Deceptive Instrumental Alignment; Chain-of-Thought.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work explores the challenge of detecting and eliminating deceptive behaviors in AI, specifically large language models (LLMs). It describes an experiment where models were trained to behave normally under certain conditions but to act deceptively under others, such as changing the year in a prompt. This study found that standard safety training methods, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training, were ineffective in removing these embedded deceptive strategies. Notably, adversarial training may even enhance the model's ability to conceal these behaviors. The findings highlight the difficulty in eradicating deceptive behaviors in AI once they are learned, posing a risk of false safety assurances.

- Backdoor Attack on Unpaired Medical Image-Text Foundation Models: A Pilot Study on MedCLIP. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01911)
  - Ruinan Jin, Chun-Yin Huang, Chenyu You, Xiaoxiao Li. *SaTML 2024*
  - Key Word: Backdoor Attacks; Medical Multi-Modal Model.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper discusses the security vulnerabilities in medical foundation models (FMs) like MedCLIP, which use unpaired image-text training. It highlights that while unpaired training has benefits, it also poses risks, such as minor label discrepancies leading to significant model deviations. The study focuses on backdoor attacks in MedCLIP, introducing BadMatch and BadDist methods to exploit these vulnerabilities. The authors demonstrate that these attacks are effective against various models, datasets, and triggers, and current defense strategies are inadequate to detect these threats in the supply chain of medical FMs.


## Privacy

<a href="https://github.com/MinghuiChen43/awesome-trustworthy-deep-learning/blob/master/FULL_LIST.md#privacy">:open_file_folder: [<b><i>Full List of Privacy</i></b>]</a>.

- Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15146)
  - Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Pratyush Maini, Zachary C. Lipton, J. Zico Kolter.
  - Key Word: Large Language Model; Memorization; Machine Unlearning; Compression.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The abstract discusses concerns about the use of permissible data in large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive web datasets, particularly focusing on whether these models memorize training data or synthesize information like humans. To address this, the study introduces the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR), a new metric to assess memorization. ACR considers data memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself, effectively using adversarial prompts to measure memorization. This metric helps monitor compliance and unlearning, offering a practical tool for evaluating potential legal issues regarding data usage in LLMs.

  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Diffusion Model.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work uncovers several key challenges that can result in incomplete, inaccurate, or biased evaluations for machine unlearning (MU) in diffusion models (DMs) by examining existing MU evaluation methods. To address them, this work enhances the evaluation metrics for MU, including the introduction of an often-overlooked retainability measurement for DMs post-unlearning. Additionally, it introduces UnlearnCanvas, a comprehensive high-resolution stylized image dataset that facilitates us to evaluate the unlearning of artistic painting styles in conjunction with associated image objects. This work shows that this dataset plays a pivotal role in establishing a standardized and automated evaluation framework for MU techniques on DMs, featuring 7 quantitative metrics to address various aspects of unlearning effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, it benchmarks 5 state-of-the-art MU methods, revealing novel insights into their pros and cons, and the underlying unlearning mechanisms.

The study identifies gradient pruning as the most effective defense strategy against advanced reconstruction attacks, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the balance between attack potency and defense efficacy in machine learning.

- Rethinking Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08787)
  - Sijia Liu, Yuanshun Yao, Jinghan Jia, Stephen Casper, Nathalie Baracaldo, Peter Hase, Xiaojun Xu, Yuguang Yao, Hang Li, Kush R. Varshney, Mohit Bansal, Sanmi Koyejo, Yang Liu.
  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Large Language Model.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The abstract discusses the concept of machine unlearning in the context of large language models (LLMs), focusing on selectively removing undesired data influences (such as sensitive or illegal content) without compromising the model's ability to generate valuable knowledge. The goal is to ensure LLMs are safe, secure, trustworthy, and resource-efficient, eliminating the need for complete retraining. It covers the conceptual basis, methodologies, metrics, and applications of LLM unlearning, addressing overlooked aspects like unlearning scope and data-model interaction. The paper also connects LLM unlearning with related fields like model editing and adversarial training, proposing an assessment framework for its efficacy, especially in copyright, privacy, and harm reduction.

- Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning at Scale via Lipschitz Regularization. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01401)
  - Jack Foster, Kyle Fogarty, Stefan Schoepf, Cengiz Öztireli, Alexandra Brintrup.
  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Differential Privacy; Lipschitz Regularization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work tackles the challenge of forgetting private or copyrighted information from machine learning models to adhere to AI and data regulations. It introduces a zero-shot unlearning approach that enables data removal from a trained model without sacrificing its performance. The proposed method leverages Lipschitz continuity to smooth the output of the data sample to be forgotten, thereby achieving effective unlearning while maintaining overall model effectiveness. Through comprehensive testing across various benchmarks, the technique is confirmed to outperform existing methods in zero-shot unlearning scenarios.

- Decentralised, Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving Machine Learning for Multi-Hospital Data. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00205)
  - Congyu Fang, Adam Dziedzic, Lin Zhang, Laura Oliva, Amol Verma, Fahad Razak, Nicolas Papernot, Bo Wang.
  - Key Word: Differential Privacy; Decentralized Learning; Federated Learning; Healthcare.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper discusses the development of Decentralized, Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (DeCaPH) for analyzing multi-hospital data without compromising patient privacy or data security. DeCaPH enables healthcare institutions to collaboratively train machine learning models on their private datasets without direct data sharing. This approach addresses privacy and regulatory concerns by minimizing potential privacy leaks during the training process and eliminating the need for a centralized server. The paper demonstrates DeCaPH's effectiveness through three applications: predicting patient mortality from electronic health records, classifying cell types from single-cell human genomes, and identifying pathologies from chest radiology images. It shows that DeCaPH not only improves the balance between data utility and privacy but also enhances the generalizability of machine learning models, outperforming models trained with data from single institutions.

- TOFU: A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06121)
  - Pratyush Maini, Zhili Feng, Avi Schwarzschild, Zachary C. Lipton, J. Zico Kolter.
  - Key Word: Machine Unlearning; Large Language Model.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper discusses the issue of large language models potentially memorizing and reproducing sensitive data, raising legal and ethical concerns. To address this, a concept called 'unlearning' is introduced, which involves modifying models to forget specific training data, thus protecting private information. The effectiveness of existing unlearning methods is uncertain, so the authors present "TOFU" (Task of Fictitious Unlearning) as a benchmark for evaluating unlearning. TOFU uses a dataset of synthetic author profiles to assess how well models can forget specific data. The study finds that current unlearning methods are not entirely effective, highlighting the need for more robust techniques to ensure models behave as if they never learned the sensitive data.

  - Ying Sheng, Shiyi Cao, Dacheng Li, Banghua Zhu, Zhuohan Li, Danyang Zhuo, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica.
  - Key Word: Fairness; Large Language Model; Large Languge Model Serving System.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring fair processing of client requests in high-demand Large Language Model (LLM) inference services. Current rate limits can lead to resource underutilization and poor client experiences. The paper introduces LLM serving fairness based on a cost function that considers input and output tokens. It presents a novel scheduling algorithm, Virtual Token Counter (VTC), which achieves fairness by continuous batching. The paper proves a tight upper bound on service difference between backlogged clients, meeting work-conserving requirements. Extensive experiments show that VTC outperforms other baseline methods in ensuring fairness under different conditions.

- A Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14394)
  - Tamar Rott Shaham, Sarah Schwettmann, Franklin Wang, Achyuta Rajaram, Evan Hernandez, Jacob Andreas, Antonio Torralba.
  - Key Word: Multimodal Modal; Automatic Interpretability; Large Language Model Agent.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper presents MAIA (Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent), a system designed to automate the understanding of neural models, including feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. MAIA uses a pre-trained vision-language model and a suite of tools to experiment iteratively on other models' subcomponents. These tools allow for the synthesis and editing of inputs, computation of maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarization of experimental results. The paper demonstrates MAIA's ability to describe neuron-level features in image representations, with results comparable to those generated by human experts. Furthermore, MAIA can reduce sensitivity to spurious features and identify inputs that are likely to be misclassified.

- Decomposing and Editing Predictions by Modeling Model Computation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11534)
  - Harshay Shah, Andrew Ilyas, Aleksander Madry.
  - Key Word: Component Attribution.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper introduces the concept of component modeling, a method to understand how machine learning models transform inputs into predictions by breaking down the model's computation into its basic functions or components. A specific task, called component attribution, is highlighted, which aims to estimate the impact of individual components on a prediction. The authors present a scalable algorithm, COAR, for estimating component attributions and demonstrate its effectiveness across various models, datasets, and modalities. They also show that component attributions estimated with COAR can be used to edit models across five tasks: fixing model errors, "forgetting" specific classes, enhancing subpopulation robustness, localizing backdoor attacks, and improving robustness to typographic attacks. 

- What needs to go right for an induction head? A mechanistic study of in-context learning circuits and their formation. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07129)
  - Aaditya K. Singh, Ted Moskovitz, Felix Hill, Stephanie C.Y. Chan, Andrew M. Saxe.
  - Key Word: Induction Head; Mechanistic Interpretability; In-Context Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Transformer models exhibit a powerful emergent ability for in-context learning, notably through a mechanism called the induction head (IH), which performs match-and-copy operations. This study explores the emergence and diversity of IHs, questioning their multiplicity, interdependence, and sudden appearance alongside a significant phase change in loss during training. Through experiments with synthetic data and a novel causal framework inspired by optogenetics for manipulating activations, the research identifies three subcircuits essential for IH formation. These findings illuminate the complex, data-dependent dynamics behind IH emergence and the specific conditions necessary for their development, advancing our understanding of in-context learning mechanisms in transformers.

- AtP*: An efficient and scalable method for localizing LLM behaviour to components. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00745)
  - János Kramár, Tom Lieberum, Rohin Shah, Neel Nanda.
  - Key Word: Activation Patching; Attribution Patching; Localization Analysis.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Activation Patching is a method used for identifying how specific parts of a model influence its behavior, but it's too resource-intensive for large language models due to its linear cost scaling. This study introduces Attribution Patching (AtP), a quicker, gradient-based alternative, but identifies two major issues that cause AtP to miss important attributions. To counter these issues, an improved version, AtP*, is proposed, which offers better performance and scalability. The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of AtP and other methods, demonstrating AtP's superiority and AtP*'s further enhancements. Additionally, it proposes a technique to limit the likelihood of overlooking relevant attributions with AtP*.

- Fine-Tuning Enhances Existing Mechanisms: A Case Study on Entity Tracking. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14811)
  - Nikhil Prakash, Tamar Rott Shaham, Tal Haklay, Yonatan Belinkov, David Bau.
  - Key Word: Fine-Tuning; Language Model; Entity Tracking; Mechanistic Interpretability.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This study investigates how fine-tuning language models on generalized tasks (like instruction following, code generation, and mathematics) affects their internal computations, with a focus on entity tracking in mathematics. It finds that fine-tuning improves, but does not fundamentally change, the internal mechanisms related to entity tracking. The same circuit responsible for entity tracking in the original model also operates in the fine-tuned models, but with enhanced performance, mainly due to better handling of positional information. The researchers used techniques like Patch Patching and DCM for identifying model components and CMAP for comparing activations across models, leading to insights on how fine-tuning optimizes existing mechanisms rather than introducing new ones.

- CogBench: a large language model walks into a psychology lab. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18225)
  - Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz, Jane X. Wang, Eric Schulz.
  - Key Word: Cognitive Psychology; Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback; Benchmarks; Large Language Model.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper presents CogBench, a benchmark tool that evaluates large language models (LLMs) using behavioral metrics from cognitive psychology, aiming for a nuanced understanding of LLM behavior. Analyzing 35 LLMs with statistical models, it finds model size and human feedback critical for performance. It notes open-source models are less risk-prone than proprietary ones, and coding-focused fine-tuning doesn't always aid behavior. The study also finds that specific prompting techniques can enhance reasoning and model-based behavior in LLMs.

- A Critical Evaluation of AI Feedback for Aligning Large Language Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12366)
  - Archit Sharma, Sedrick Keh, Eric Mitchell, Chelsea Finn, Kushal Arora, Thomas Kollar.
  - Key Word: Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper critiques the effectiveness of the Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) approach, commonly used to enhance the instruction-following capabilities of advanced pre-trained language models. It argues that the significant performance gains attributed to the reinforcement learning (RL) phase of RLAIF might be misleading. The paper suggests these improvements primarily stem from the initial use of a weaker teacher model for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) compared to a more advanced critic model for RL feedback. Through experimentation, it is demonstrated that simply using a more advanced model (e.g., GPT-4) for SFT can outperform the traditional RLAIF method. The study further explores how the effectiveness of RLAIF varies depending on the base model family, evaluation protocols, and critic models used. It concludes by offering a mechanistic insight into scenarios where SFT might surpass RLAIF and provides recommendations for optimizing RLAIF's practical application.

  - Souradip Chakraborty, Jiahao Qiu, Hui Yuan, Alec Koppel, Furong Huang, Dinesh Manocha, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mengdi Wang.
  - Key Word: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback; Diversity in Human Preferences.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This abstract addresses the limitations of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language models, specifically its inability to capture the diversity of human preferences using a single reward model. The authors present an "impossibility result" demonstrating this limitation and propose a solution that involves learning a mixture of preference distributions and employing a MaxMin alignment objective inspired by egalitarian principles. This approach aims to more fairly represent diverse human preferences. They connect their method to distributionally robust optimization and general utility reinforcement learning, showcasing its robustness and generality. Experimental results with GPT-2 and Tulu2-7B models demonstrate significant improvements in aligning with diverse human preferences, including a notable increase in win-rates and fairness for minority groups. The findings suggest the approach's applicability beyond language models to reinforcement learning at large.

  - Jiaming Ji, Boyuan Chen, Hantao Lou, Donghai Hong, Borong Zhang, Xuehai Pan, Juntao Dai, Yaodong Yang.
  - Key Word: Large Language Model; Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback; Weak-to-Strong Generalization.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper presents Aligner, a novel approach for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) without the complexities of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Aligner, an autoregressive seq2seq model, is trained on query-answer-correction data through supervised learning, offering a resource-efficient solution for model alignment. It enables significant performance improvements in LLMs by learning correctional residuals between aligned and unaligned outputs. Notably, Aligner enhances various LLMs' helpfulness and harmlessness, with substantial gains observed in models like GPT-4 and Llama2 when supervised by Aligner. The approach is model-agnostic and easily integrated with different models.

  - Key Word: Language Model Alignment; Language Model Decoding; Guided Decoding.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper introduces ARGS (Alignment as Reward-Guided Search), a new method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human objectives without the instability and high resource demands of common approaches like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). ARGS integrates alignment directly into the decoding process, using a reward signal to adjust the model's probabilistic predictions, which generates texts aligned with human preferences and maintains semantic diversity. The framework has shown to consistently improve average rewards across different alignment tasks and model sizes, significantly outperforming baselines. For instance, it increased the average reward by 19.56% over the baseline in a GPT-4 evaluation. ARGS represents a step towards creating more responsive LLMs by focusing on alignment at the decoding stage. 

- WARM: On the Benefits of Weight Averaged Reward Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12187)
  - Alexandre Ramé, Nino Vieillard, Léonard Hussenot, Robert Dadashi, Geoffrey Cideron, Olivier Bachem, Johan Ferret.
  - Key Word: Alignment; RLHF; Reward Modeling; Model Merging.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences using reinforcement learning can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs manipulate the reward model (RM) to get high rewards without truly meeting objectives. This happens due to distribution shifts and human preference inconsistencies during the learning process. To address this, the proposed Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM) strategy involves fine-tuning multiple RMs and then averaging them in weight space, leveraging the linear mode connection of fine-tuned weights with the same pre-training. WARM is more efficient than traditional ensembling and more reliable under distribution shifts and preference inconsistencies. Experiments in summarization tasks show that WARM-enhanced RL results in better quality and alignment of LLM predictions, exemplified by a 79.4% win rate of a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM against one fine-tuned with a single RM.

  - Zixiang Chen, Yihe Deng, Huizhuo Yuan, Kaixuan Ji, Quanquan Gu.
  - Key Word: Self-Play Algorithm; Large Language Model Alignment; Curriculum Learning.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This paper introduces a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN) to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring additional human-annotated data. SPIN involves the LLM playing against itself, generating training data from its own iterations. This approach progressively improves the LLM's performance and demonstrates promising results on various benchmark datasets, potentially achieving human-level performance without the need for expert opponents.

  - Key Word: Specification; Game Theory; AI Regulation.
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The paper presents a novel framework for trustworthy machine learning (ML), addressing the need for a comprehensive approach that includes fairness, privacy, and the distinction between model trainers and trust assessors. It proposes viewing trustworthy ML as a multi-objective multi-agent optimization problem, leading to a game-theoretic formulation named regulation games. Specifically, it introduces an instance called the SpecGame, which models the dynamics between ML model builders and regulators focused on fairness and privacy. The paper also introduces ParetoPlay, an innovative equilibrium search algorithm designed to find socially optimal solutions that keep agents within the Pareto frontier of their objectives. Through simulations of SpecGame using ParetoPlay, the paper offers insights into ML regulation policies. For example, it demonstrates that regulators can achieve significantly lower privacy budgets in gender classification applications by proactively setting their specifications.
